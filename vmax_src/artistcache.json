With his instantly recognizable gravelly voice, Armstrong was also an influential singer, demonstrating great dexterity as an improviser, bending the lyrics and melody of a song for expressive purposes. He was also skilled at scat singing (vocalizing using sounds and syllables instead of actual lyrics).\nRenowned for his charismatic stage presence and voice almost as much as for his trumpet-playing, Armstrong's influence extends well beyond jazz music, and by the end of his career in the 1960s, he was widely regarded as a profound influence on popular music in general. Armstrong was one of the first truly popular African-American entertainers to \"cross over\", whose skin color was secondary to his music in an America that was severely racially divided. He rarely publicly politicized his race, often to the dismay of fellow African-Americans, but took a well-publicized stand for desegregation during the Little Rock Crisis. His artistry and personality allowed him socially acceptable access to the upper echelons of American society that were highly restricted for black men.", "albums": {"Complete RCA Victor Recordings": "https://i.scdn.co/image/9f7e0211d5bdf257a2919c8ab97bea23e6ec2108", "Volume IV -

Called the King of Pop, his contributions to music and dance, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades.\nThe eighth child of the Jackson family, he debuted on the professional music scene along with his elder brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5 in 1964, and began his solo career in 1971. In the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant figure in popular music. The music videos for his songs, including those of \"Beat It\", \"Billie Jean\", and \"Thriller\", were credited with breaking down racial barriers and with transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool. The popularity of these videos helped to bring the then-relatively-new television channel MTV to fame. With videos such as \"Black or White\" and \"Scream\", he continued to innovate the medium throughout the 1990s, as well as forging a reputation as a touring solo artist. Through stage and video performances, Jackson popularized a number of complicated dance techniques, such as the robot and the moonwalk, to which he gave the name. His distinctive sound and style has influenced numerous artists of various music genres.\nJackson's 1982 album Thriller is the best-selling album of all time. His other albums, including Off the Wall (1979), Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991), and HIStory (1995), also rank among the world's best-selling albums. Jackson is one of the few artists to have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice. He was also inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Dance Hall of Fame as the first and only dancer from pop and rock music. His other achievements include multiple Guinness World Records, 13 Grammy Awards, the Grammy Legend Award, the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, 26 American Music Awards\u2014more than any other artist\u2014including the \"Artist of the Century\" and \"Artist of the 1980s\", 13 number-one singles in the United States during his solo career,\u2014more than any other male artist in the Hot 100 era\u2014and estimated sales of over 400 million records worldwide. Jackson has won hundreds of awards, making him the most awarded recording artist in the history of popular music. He became the first artist in history to have a top ten single in the Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades when \"Love Never Felt So Good\" reached number nine on May 21, 2014. Jackson traveled the world attending events honoring his humanitarianism, and, in 2000, the Guinness World Records recognized him for supporting 39 charities, more than any other entertainer.\nAspects of Michael Jackson's personal life, including his changing appearance, personal relationships, and behavior, generated controversy. In the mid-1990s, he was accused of child sexual abuse, but the civil case was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount and no formal charges were brought. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges after the jury found him not guilty on all counts. While preparing for his comeback concert series titled This Is It, Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication on June 25, 2009, after suffering from cardiac arrest. The Los Angeles County Coroner ruled his death a homicide, and his personal physician Conrad Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Jackson's death triggered a global outpouring of grief and a live broadcast of his public memorial service was viewed around the world.", "albums": {"Thriller 25 Super Deluxe Edition": "https://i.scdn.co/image/e337f3661f68bc4d96a554de0ad7988d65edb25a", "Music & Me": "https://i.scdn.co/image/215176c716f4f1951ef1a6f0884f898f5d0c77ee", "Bad 25th Anniversary": "https://i.scdn.co/image/ae7f1397024f8fa62668612af930c22915108302", "Ben": "https://i.scdn.co/image/c37d3813aeccc73f95d3c0a589d94e39899a50eb", "Off the Wall": "https://i.scdn.co/image/4e883b352604514f02bb47d45e87322bd4376115", "Forever Michael": "https://i.scdn.co/image/53a46521f5a8f5aa229f1271f9679a4f6f2f43be", "Music and Me": "https://i.scdn.co/image/f6c1e3e5d36cb4f4b1bbe55468ccede0ff0c7f9b", "Invincible": "https://i.scdn.co/image/c66ad944c117d96700781416ecb1779bdc511a69", "Michael": "https://i.scdn.co/image/dbe1e895e7ee3b08796610143b0b5deff1f13d63", "HIStory - PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE - BOOK I": "https://i.scdn.co/image/3c1b44232bf2c26c87a6a02bc714d692c90bfb7a", "Forever, Michael": "https://i.scdn.co/image/60f1f9a662702b7de8ea89f943f3e640a6b4cff1", "XSCAPE - Track by Track Commentary": "https://i.scdn.co/image/a85212380dbcb4bfd4bbd94ca95cfa8ef6bcc3e3", "Bad (Alben f\u00fcr die Ewigkeit)": "https://i.scdn.co/image/16d60687aca08269a8318fb33f1f4007df1b6823", "HIStory - PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE - Book I": "https://i.scdn.co/image/46d019a6be25f60a823439a339b9add7afd93ac2", "BLOOD ON THE DANCE FLOOR/ HIStory In The Mix": "https://i.scdn.co/image/c59497516b1ce0bdf6f05347c5df66965cc991db", "Dangerous": "https://i.scdn.co/image/2d7b6762c3a0cecd0530ae650090f1804c852a5e", "Bad (Remastered)": "https://i.scdn.co/image/74e2e7b7b5c916e785cd3a5fc1b3d117932166ec", "Got To Be There": "https://i.scdn.co/image/10b87fae423b603d14134e3d1db9111f65f6570c", "Thriller (Alben f\u00fcr die Ewigkeit)": "https://i.scdn.co/image/746fd8a81bcd945d3ca36eda2d4155d2ed4d09e1", "XSCAPE": "https://i.scdn.co/image/733fb672fbedb230487b8d3d38b4dd14761f72e8", "Thriller": "https://i.scdn.co/image/a743b6fed33ddb79e39433baa60e51dc9880192f"}, "name": "Michael Jackson", "img": "https://i.scdn.co/image/738650ce127e119788a7bca020fbd054b5aa57b5"}, "7dGJo4pcD2V6oG8kP0tJRR": {"toptracks": ["'Till I Collapse", "Lose Yourself - Soundtrack Version", "Forever"], "bio": "Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972), better known by his stage name Eminem, is an American rapper, record producer, and songwriter from Detroit, Michigan. In addition to his solo career, he is a member of D12 and (with Royce da 5'9\") half of the hip-hop duo Bad Meets Evil. Eminem is the best-selling artist of the 2000s in the United States; Rolling Stone ranked him 83rd on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, calling him the King of Hip Hop. Including his work with D12 and Bad Meets Evil, Eminem has had ten number-one albums on the Billboard 200. He has sold more than 155 million albums and singles, making him one of the world's best-selling artists. As of June 2014, Eminem is the second-bestselling male artist of the Nielsen SoundScan era, the sixth-bestselling artist in the United States and the bestselling hip-hop artist, with sales of 45,160,000 albums and 31 million digital singles.\nAfter his debut album Infinite (1996), Eminem achieved mainstream popularity in 1999 with The Slim Shady LP; the commercially successful second album received his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. His next two releases (2000's The Marshall Mathers LP and 2002's The Eminem Show) were worldwide successes, with each certified diamond in US sales. Both won Best Rap Album Grammy Awards, making Eminem the first artist to win the award for three consecutive LPs. They were followed by Encore in 2004, another critical and commercial success. Eminem went on hiatus after touring in 2005, releasing Relapse in 2009 and Recovery in 2010; both won Grammy Awards. Recovery was the bestselling album of 2010 worldwide, and the rapper's second international bestselling album of the year (his first was The Eminem Show). Eminem's eighth album (2013's The Marshall Mathers LP 2) won two Grammy Awards, including Best Rap Album; it expanded his record for the most wins in that category and his Grammy total to 15.\nEminem has developed other ventures, including Shady Records with manager Paul Rosenberg. He has his own channel, Shade 45, on Sirius XM Radio. In November 2002, Eminem starred in the hip hop film 8 Mile. He won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"Lose Yourself\", the first rap artist to win the award.

Evans's use of impressionist harmony, inventive interpretation of traditional jazz repertoire, block chords, and trademark rhythmically independent, \"singing\" melodic lines continue to influence jazz pianists today.\nBorn in Plainfield, New Jersey, he was classically trained, and studied at Southeastern Louisiana University. In 1955, he moved to New York, where he worked with bandleader and theorist George Russell. In 1958, Evans joined Miles Davis's sextet, where he was to have a profound influence. In 1959, the band, then immersed in modal jazz, recorded Kind of Blue, the best-selling jazz album of all time.\nIn late 1959, Evans left the Miles Davis band and began his career as a leader with Scott LaFaro and Paul Motian, a group now regarded as a seminal modern jazz trio. In 1961, ten days after recording the highly acclaimed Sunday at the Village Vanguard and Waltz for Debby, LaFaro died in a car accident. After months of seclusion, Evans re-emerged with a new trio, featuring bassist Chuck Israels.\nIn 1963, Evans recorded Conversations with Myself, an innovative solo album using the unconventional (in jazz solo recordings) technique of overdubbing over himself. In 1966, he met bassist Eddie G\u00f3mez, with whom he would work for eleven years. Several successful albums followed, such as Bill Evans at the Montreux Jazz Festival, Alone and The Bill Evans Album, among others.\nDespite his success as a jazz artist, Evans suffered personal loss and struggled with drug abuse. Both his girlfriend Elaine and his brother Harry committed suicide, and he was a long time user of heroin, and later of cocaine. As a result, his financial stability, personal relationships and musical creativity all steadily declined during his later years.\nMany of his compositions, such as \"Waltz for Debby\", have become standards and have been played and recorded by many artists. Evans was honored with 31 Grammy nominations and seven awards, and was inducted in the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame.", "albums": {"Intermodulation": "https://i.scdn.co/image/ff3cc9c55e57bfb8454fb31fc1d9923c4b113653", "Bill Evans: Verve Ultimate Cool": "https://i.scdn.co/image/0677f108763e26aa52a0a6e585c44782fa46ac41", "The Best Of Bill Evans Live": "https://i.scdn.co/image/92348045caa354fa59e68a464dc13d7bd5ce9220", "The Solo Sessions Volume 1": "https://i.scdn.co/image/ddb3892ab922fe4decfe6337107aaf0ca873bd04", "Jazz Showcase": "https://i.scdn.co/image/4e3c013610518f6e7e659be159ac4d41b744af9e", "Essential Standards": "https://i.scdn.co/image/c5c6e784fc71f76eef34137ce2321809fb2475b5", "From Left To Right": "https://i.scdn.co/image/12c92252233698ee65996d835d35349a8485003b", "Further Conversations With Myself": "https://i.scdn.co/image/77aaab0af2d334ece56417b90fb7abb4f89d05e7", "At Shelly's Manne-Hole": "https://i.scdn.co/image/a32bedc22cddf40f050a54b41b1714a66c332a23", "Crosscurrents": "https://i.scdn.co/image/ed4dcc8073afe3db69fb5214c6b573268bf83b51", "Native and Fine": "https://i.scdn.co/image/c258fb6f1293b22ee03102eb2be15f4cfb73014f", "At The Montreux Jazz Festival": "https://i.scdn.co/image/019f55ac957e16203d6886dcf0a07c869f8282db", "Tenderly (An Informal Session)": "https://i.scdn.co/image/71bb3e7b7dc960fa650805dd822912f3c351a1dc", "Together Again (Remastered)": "https://i.scdn.co/image/2230cc78da88ad94969d18346fd04dfeadda4bc7", "The Definitive Bill Evans on Riverside and Fantasy": "https://i.scdn.co/image/51337c9c9ec36f6f9743e0367a7163b382049104", "Affinity": "https://i.scdn.co/image/817335b46611df41d423da9a27706b8cb314d31e", "The Tony Bennett / Bill Evans Album": "https://i.scdn.co/image/84f409ccf45b2dd7bf0dbbdc365a88c9ddcf8c3d", "Conversations With Myself": "https://i.scdn.co/image/64d6ab2b1464848637eda02b19709d0144f522ba", "California, Here I Come": "https://i.scdn.co/image/61120c98992effe7f87dc5f8af8839cad631d8a8", "The Best Of Bill Evans (Remastered)": "https://i.scdn.co/image/b2f036e423f85b8a89fcf94918583298d89a464b", "Bill Evans: Turn Out the Stars/The Final Village Vanguard Recordings June 1980": "https://i.scdn.co/image/e7101594b47903a6370fac7a0b43934f0d0f0d39", "Ultimate Bill Evans": "https://i.scdn.co/image/3852541e26a180e671b6e1ca88cc139a9cbf6fff", "New Jazz Conceptions": "https://i.scdn.co/image/d041028a3210d3e95c3843543025dc50d19be19a", "Living In The Crest Of A Wave": "https://i.scdn.co/image/0c4f4bd2e0898151bd12aced7f3cecc9b6757038", "The Solo Sessions, Vol. 2 (Remastered)": "https://i.scdn.co/image/b23ee9c799452d9e4144cda703109f9f4e84773c", "Half Moon Bay": "https://i.scdn.co/image/eb4caec87dcbae31e14e2d9c0bbd356df7538b6d", "Verve Jazz Masters 5: Bill Evans": "https://i.scdn.co/image/b761a536306acec584b5e08cd4c89d59b0ddc4e3", "Piano Poet": "https://i.scdn.co/image/5c34e9f82b997635c9f256f40f4aa5e8e68ca501", "The Tony Bennett / Bill Evans Album (Expanded Reissue)": "https://i.scdn.co/image/7aba2e459f3c17eef42da5f2144e9e6156c92c11", "Riverside Profiles: Bill Evans (International Version -

West first became known as a producer for Roc-A-Fella Records; he achieved recognition for his work on rapper Jay-Z's The Blueprint (2001), as well as hit singles for musical artists including Alicia Keys, Ludacris, and Janet Jackson. His style of production originally used high-pitched vocal samples from soul songs incorporated with his own drums and instruments. He later broadened his influences to include 1970s R&B, baroque pop, trip hop, arena rock, house, folk, alternative, electronica, synthpop, industrial, and classical music.\nWest was raised in a middle-class household in Chicago, Illinois, and began rapping in the third grade, becoming involved in the city's hip hop scene. West attended art school for one semester before dropping out to pursue music entirely in the late 1990s. Although his real desire was to become a rapper, record executives did not take West seriously, viewing him as a producer first and foremost. After being signed to Roc-A-Fella in 2002, West released his debut album The College Dropout in 2004 to commercial and critical acclaim. The baroque-inspired Late Registration followed in 2005, and Graduation in 2007. West switched rapping for singing on his emotive 2008 effort 808's & Heartbreak, and embraced maximalism on 2010's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. Following several collaborations, West released his abrasive sixth album, Yeezus, in 2013.\nWest is one of the best-selling artists of all time, having sold more than 21 million albums and 100 million digital downloads. He has won a total of 21 Grammy Awards, making him one of the most awarded artists of all-time and the most Grammy-awarded artist of his age. Time named West one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2005, 2011 and 2015. He has also been included in a number of Forbes annual lists. Three of his albums rank on Rolling Stone's 2012 \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" list; two of his albums feature at #8 and #1 in Pitchfork Media's The 100 Best Albums of 2010\u20132014.\nWest's background and style, from his debut album, deviated from the then-dominant \"gangsta\" persona in hip hop, and he would later alter the genre stylistically as rappers adopted his alternative aesthetic. An outspoken and controversial celebrity, West has often been a source of controversy due to his appearances at award shows and his various television and radio interviews. West has collaborated on multiple occasions with brands Nike, Louis Vuitton, Adidas and A.P.C.. West also runs his own record label GOOD Music and has directed several short films.", "albums": {"Watch The Throne [Deluxe Edition (Explicit)]": "https://i.scdn.co/image/d794460520c3ace23242ab5dd2be938695723848", "Yeezus": "https://i.scdn.co/image/30f1e8a854cfe95593e29b05f9d56d8f624514ad", "Watch The Throne": "https://i.scdn.co/image/d794460520c3ace23242ab5dd2be938695723848", "Graduation (Deluxe Edition - Explicit)": "https://i.scdn.co/image/9c5d67e52b89706dbcdfbf69e612bffb7ef3583a", "Graduation": "https://i.scdn.co/image/e6480e795bebf99cef0dbf45bbd7925705422505", "The College Dropout": "https://i.scdn.co/image/f4573fe74d176d40a1bb402df28be01a1cef662c", "808s & Heartbreak": "https://i.scdn.co/image/fe02c52f0e3b3f22513eb04abef1617f380ba122", "Watch The Throne [Deluxe Edition (Edited)]": "https://i.scdn.co/image/d794460520c3ace23242ab5dd2be938695723848", "Late Registration": "https://i.scdn.co/image/ebe05f22afccf6c8a7e3a9c708bc5143269ae3bf", "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy": "https://i.scdn.co/image/8ec327bb0d8453aff35d1e10a8d6257a3aaab3d4", "Late Orchestration": "https://i.scdn.co/image/94b55798fafa6159d6c08dc12f8044772b78ba57"}, "name": "Kanye West", "img": "https://i.scdn.co/image/fca17e83545e076fafb561569e8d5ec64f87eb8c"}, "0kbYTNQb4Pb1rPbbaF0pT4": {"toptracks": ["Blue in Green", "So What", "Flamenco Sketches"], "bio": "Miles Dewey Davis III (May 26, 1926 \u2013 September 28, 1991) was an American jazz musician, trumpeter, bandleader, and composer.

In 2008, his 1959 album Kind of Blue received its fourth platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipments of at least four million copies in the United States.
