            "biography": "The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the greatest and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several genres, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \"Beatlemania\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the era's sociocultural revolutions.\nThe Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960, during which Stuart Sutcliffe briefly served as a fifth member until his death. The core of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison went through a succession of drummers, most notably Pete Best, before settling on Starr. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act and producer George Martin enhanced their musical potential. They gained popularity in the United Kingdom after their first hit, \"Love Me Do\", in late 1962. They acquired the nickname \"the Fab Four\" as Beatlemania grew in Britain over the following year, and by early 1964 they had become international stars, leading the \"British Invasion\" of the United States pop market. From 1965 onwards, the Beatles produced what many consider their finest material, including the innovative and widely influential albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966), Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), The Beatles (commonly known as the White Album, 1968) and Abbey Road (1969).\nAfter their break-up in 1970, they all enjoyed successful musical careers of varying lengths. McCartney and Starr, the surviving members, remain musically active. Lennon was shot and killed in December 1980, and Harrison died of lung cancer in November 2001.\nAccording to the RIAA, the Beatles are the best-selling music artists in the United States, with 178 million certified units. They have had more number-one albums on the British charts and sold more singles in the UK than any other act. In 2008, the group topped Billboard magazine's list of the all-time most successful \"Hot 100\" artists; as of 2015, they hold the record for most number-one hits on the Hot 100 chart with twenty. They have received ten Grammy Awards, an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards. Collectively included in Time magazine's compilation of the twentieth century's 100 most influential people, they are the best-selling band in history, with estimated sales of over 600 million records worldwide. The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, with all four being inducted individually as well from 1994 to 2015."

            "biography": "Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 \u2013 August 16, 1977) was an American singer and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as \"the King of Rock and Roll\", or simply, \"the King\".\nPresley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and when he was 13 years old, he and his family relocated to Memphis, Tennessee. His music career began there in 1954, when he recorded a song with producer Sam Phillips at Sun Records. Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, Presley was an early popularizer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who managed the singer for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, \"Heartbreak Hotel\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. He was regarded as the leading figure of rock and roll after a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines that coincided with the dawn of the Civil Rights Movement, made him enormously popular\u2014and controversial.\nIn November 1956, he made his film debut in Love Me Tender. In 1958, he was drafted into military service. He resumed his recording career two years later, producing some of his most commercially successful work before devoting much of the 1960s to making Hollywood movies and their accompanying soundtrack albums, most of which were critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed televised comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley was featured in the first globally broadcast concert via satellite, Aloha from Hawaii. Several years of prescription drug abuse severely damaged his health, and he died in 1977 at the age of 42.\nPresley is one of the most celebrated and influential musicians of the 20th century. Commercially successful in many genres, including pop, blues and gospel, he is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music, with estimated record sales of around 600 million units worldwide. He won three Grammys, also receiving the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame. Forbes named Elvis Presley as the 2nd top earning dead celebrity with $55 million as of 2011."

            "editors_notes": "Thriller’s late-1982 release marked the beginning of Michael Jackson’s entry into another level of fame; it also saw the end of a great five-year period of creativity that had seen him raise his solo game on the unstoppable Off the Wall and make heavy contributions to the Jacksons’ Destiny and Triumph. Stripping the weight of history from Thriller is a big job, but hearing the record as a statement in itself remains hugely rewarding. Seven of its nine original cuts were Top Ten singles, but more important is the way Jackson and producer Quincy Jones turned the singer’s obsessions into intricate, stunningly sung pop-funk. From the knowing humor of the title track to the dread of \"Billie Jean\" and \"Beat It\" and the irresistible cuteness of \"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\" and \"Baby Be Mine,\" Thriller finds Jackson at an artistic height. A quarter century later, it still sells. And nostalgia is far down the list of reasons why. This special edition includes \"Someone in the Dark\" from an E.T. story album, a \"Billie Jean\" demo, outtakes and numerous intriguing, amusing interview segments with Jones and songwriting collaborator Rod Temperton.",

            "biography": "Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 \u2013 June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, record producer, dancer, and actor. Called the King of Pop, his contributions to music and dance, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades.\nThe eighth child of the Jackson family, he debuted on the professional music scene along with his elder brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5 in 1964, and began his solo career in 1971. In the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant figure in popular music. The music videos for his songs, including those of \"Beat It\", \"Billie Jean\", and \"Thriller\", were credited with breaking down racial barriers and with transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool. The popularity of these videos helped to bring the then-relatively-new television channel MTV to fame. With videos such as \"Black or White\" and \"Scream\", he continued to innovate the medium throughout the 1990s, as well as forging a reputation as a touring solo artist. Through stage and video performances, Jackson popularized a number of complicated dance techniques, such as the robot and the moonwalk, to which he gave the name. His distinctive sound and style has influenced numerous artists of various music genres.\nJackson's 1982 album Thriller is the best-selling album of all time. His other albums, including Off the Wall (1979), Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991), and HIStory (1995), also rank among the world's best-selling albums. Jackson is one of the few artists to have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice. He was also inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Dance Hall of Fame as the first and only dancer from pop and rock music. His other achievements include multiple Guinness World Records, 13 Grammy Awards, the Grammy Legend Award, the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, 26 American Music Awards\u2014more than any other artist\u2014including the \"Artist of the Century\" and \"Artist of the 1980s\", 13 number-one singles in the United States during his solo career,\u2014more than any other male artist in the Hot 100 era\u2014and estimated sales of over 400 million records worldwide. Jackson has won hundreds of awards, making him the most awarded recording artist in the history of popular music. He became the first artist in history to have a top ten single in the Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades when \"Love Never Felt So Good\" reached number nine on May 21, 2014. Jackson traveled the world attending events honoring his humanitarianism, and, in 2000, the Guinness World Records recognized him for supporting 39 charities, more than any other entertainer.\nAspects of Michael Jackson's personal life, including his changing appearance, personal relationships, and behavior, generated controversy. In the mid-1990s, he was accused of child sexual abuse, but the civil case was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount and no formal charges were brought. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges after the jury found him not guilty on all counts. While preparing for his comeback concert series titled This Is It, Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication on June 25, 2009, after suffering from cardiac arrest. The Los Angeles County Coroner ruled his death a homicide, and his personal physician Conrad Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Jackson's death triggered a global outpouring of grief and a live broadcast of his public memorial service was viewed around the world."

            "editors_notes": "Trading the cinematic aspirations of Tumbleweed Connection for a tentative stab at prog rock, Elton John and Bernie Taupin delivered another excellent collection of songs with Madman Across the Water. Like its two predecessors, Madman Across the Water is driven by the sweeping string arrangements of Paul Buckmaster, who gives the songs here a richly dark and haunting edge. And these are songs that benefit from grandiose treatments. With most songs clocking in around five minutes, the record feels like a major work, and in many ways it is. While it's not as adventurous as Tumbleweed Connection, the overall quality of the record is very high, particularly on character sketches \"Levon\" and \"Razor Face,\" as well as the melodramatic \"Tiny Dancer\" and the paranoid title track. Madman Across the Water begins to fall apart toward the end, but the record remains an ambitious and rewarding work, and John never attained its darkly introspective atmosphere again. ",

            "biography": "Sir Elton Hercules John CBE (born Reginald Kenneth Dwight, 25 March 1947) is an English songwriter and singer, who accompanies himself on the piano. He has worked with lyricist Bernie Taupin as his songwriter partner since 1967; they have collaborated on more than 30 albums to date. In his five-decade career Elton John has sold more than 300 million records, making him one of the best-selling music artists in the world. He has more than fifty Top 40 hits, including seven consecutive No. 1 US albums, 58 Billboard Top 40 singles, 27 Top 10, four No. 2 and nine No. 1. For 31 consecutive years (1970\u20132000) he had at least one song in the Billboard Hot 100. His single \"Something About the Way You Look Tonight\"/\"Candle in the Wind 1997\" sold over 33 million copies worldwide and is \"the best-selling single of all time\". He has also composed music, produced records, and has occasionally acted in films. John owned Watford Football Club from 1976 to 1987, and remains the club's president.\nElton John was born Reginald Dwight in 1947, and raised in the Pinner area of London. He learned to play piano at an early age, and by 1962 had formed Bluesology. John met his songwriter partner, Bernie Taupin, in 1967, after they had both answered an advert for songwriters. For two years they wrote songs for other artists, including Roger Cook and Lulu, and John also worked as a session musician for artists such as the Hollies and the Scaffold. In 1968 his debut album, Empty Sky, was released. In 1970 a single, \"Your Song\", from his second album, Elton John, reached the top ten in the UK and the US, his first hit single.\nHe has received six Grammy Awards, five Brit Awards \u2013 winning two awards for Outstanding Contribution to Music and the first Brits Icon in 2013 for his \"lasting impact on British culture\", an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Tony Award, a Disney Legend award, and the Kennedy Center Honors in 2004. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked him Number 49 on its list of 100 influential musicians of the rock and roll era. In 2013, Billboard ranked him the most successful male solo artist on \"The Billboard Hot 100 Top All-Time Artists\" (third overall behind the Beatles and Madonna). He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994, is an inductee into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame, and is a fellow of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. Having been named a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1996, John received a knighthood from Elizabeth II for \"services to music and charitable services\" in 1998. John has performed at a number of royal events, such as the funeral of Princess Diana at Westminster Abbey in 1997, the Party at the Palace in 2002 and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Concert outside Buckingham Palace in 2012.\nHe has been heavily involved in the fight against AIDS since the late 1980s. In 1992, he established the Elton John AIDS Foundation and a year later began hosting the annual Academy Award Party, which has since become one of the highest-profile Oscar parties in the Hollywood film industry. Since its inception, the foundation has raised over $200 million. John, who announced he was bisexual in 1976 and has been openly gay since 1988, entered into a civil partnership with David Furnish on 21 December 2005, and after gay marriage became legal in England, wed Furnish on 21 December 2014. He continues to be a champion for LGBT social movements worldwide and same-sex marriage."

For album number four, often referred to as \"Runes\" for the Runic symbols on the cover, Zep pulled all the aspects of their legend into tight focus. \"Black Dog\" twisted a blues-boogie riff around Robert Plant’s macho swagger and drummer John Bonham’s unerring sense of time, while \"Rock and Roll\" took a primordial textbook guitar riff and slammed it into the ground. A mandolin and English folk legend Sandy Denny perfectly complement \"The Battle of Evermore\" and set the stage for the band’s magnum opus, \"Stairway to Heaven,\" where for eight minutes the band builds its \"Bolero,\" a simmering to a boil dynamic wedded to a serpentine melody that leads from a mystical English garden to a raving, megalomaniacal climax. \"Misty Mountain Hop\" and \"Four Sticks\" exhibit the band’s unusually funky approach to hard rock rhythms. \"Going to California\" retains a hippie mysticism in its folk roots, while \"When the Levee Breaks\" shudders with the cataclysmic wallop of John Bonham and guitars that practically bleed from the speakers. Led Zeppelin never cut a bad studio album and most of their work is essential listening to any serious rock music fan. But Led Zeppelin IV remains the group’s crowning achievement.",

            "biography": "Led Zeppelin were an English rock band formed in London in 1968. The group consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. The band's heavy, guitar-driven sound, rooted in blues and psychedelia on their early albums, has earned them recognition as one of the progenitors of heavy metal, though their unique style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk music.\nAfter changing their name from the New Yardbirds, Led Zeppelin signed a deal with Atlantic Records that afforded them considerable artistic freedom. Although the group was initially unpopular with critics, they achieved significant commercial success with albums such as Led Zeppelin (1969), Led Zeppelin II (1969), Led Zeppelin III (1970), their untitled fourth album (1971), Houses of the Holy (1973), and Physical Graffiti (1975). Their fourth album, which features the track \"Stairway to Heaven\", is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and it helped to secure the group's popularity.\nPage wrote most of Led Zeppelin's music, particularly early in their career, while Plant generally supplied the lyrics. Jones' keyboard-based compositions later became central to the group's catalogue, which featured increasing experimentation. The latter half of their career saw a series of record-breaking tours that earned the group a reputation for excess and debauchery. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, their output and touring schedule were limited during the late 1970s, and the group disbanded following Bonham's death from alcohol-related asphyxia in 1980. In the decades that followed, the surviving members sporadically collaborated and participated in one-off Led Zeppelin reunions. The most successful of these was the 2007 Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert in London, with Jason Bonham taking his late father's place behind the drums. Plant and Page performed Led Zeppelin songs without Jones, accompanied by others such as the Cure\u2019s Porl Thompson and the London Metropolitan Orchestra.\nLed Zeppelin are widely considered one of the most successful, innovative, and influential rock groups in history. They are one of the best-selling music artists in the history of audio recording; various sources estimate the group's record sales at 200 to 300 million units worldwide. With RIAA-certified sales of 111.5 million units, they are the second-best-selling band in the United States. Each of their nine studio albums placed in the top 10 of the Billboard album chart and six reached the number-one spot. Rolling Stone magazine described them as \"the heaviest band of all time\", \"the biggest band of the '70s\", and \"unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history\". They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995; the museum's biography of the band states that they were \"as influential\" during the 1970s as the Beatles were during the 1960s."

            "biography": "Pink Floyd were an English rock band formed in London. They achieved international acclaim with their progressive and psychedelic music. Distinguished by their use of philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation, extended compositions and elaborate live shows, they are one of the most commercially successful and musically influential groups in the history of popular music.\nPink Floyd were founded in 1965 by students Syd Barrett, Nick Mason, Roger Waters, and Richard Wright. They gained popularity performing in London's underground music scene during the late 1960s, and under Barrett's leadership released two charting singles and a successful debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). David Gilmour joined as a fifth member in December 1967; Barrett left the band in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health exacerbated by drug use. Waters became the band's primary lyricist and, by the mid-1970s, their dominant songwriter, devising the concepts behind their critically and commercially successful albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977), The Wall (1979) and The Final Cut (1983).\nWright left Pink Floyd in 1979, followed by Waters in 1985, declaring it a \"spent force\". Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd; Wright rejoined them as a session musician and, later, a band member. The three produced two more albums, A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell (1994), and toured until 1994. After nearly two decades of acrimony, Pink Floyd reunited with Waters in 2005 for a performance at the global awareness event Live 8, but Gilmour and Waters have since stated they have no plans to reunite as a band again. Barrett died in 2006 and Wright in 2008. The final Pink Floyd studio album, The Endless River, recorded without Waters and based on material recorded in 1993\u20131994, was released in November 2014.\nPink Floyd were inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. By 2013, the band had sold more than 250 million records worldwide, including 75 million certified units in the United States."

            "editors_notes": "Looking back, Daydream can be seen as a demarcation point in Mariah Carey’s career. At the time, the singer had built her enormous success upon powerhouse ballads and frothy dance tunes. Daydream nudged Carey towards a more hip-hop based sound, moving her away from grand love arias and towards streetwise jams. That’s not to say that the big ballads are absent — \"I Am Free\" and an overwrought remake of Journey’s \"Open Arms\" give her plenty of room to exercise her phenomenal pipes. But the best moments come when Mariah climbs off her pedestal and mixes it up with lesser mortals. \"Fantasy\" lets her voice slither and glide around an effervescent track taken from Tom Tom Club’s \"Genius of Love.\" \"One Sweet Day\" (her shiver-inducing duet with Boyz II Men) and \"Always Be My Baby\" borrow from early R&B to create an organic yet ethereal feel. And \"Melt Away\" lives up to its title as Mariah delivers a molten performance. Mariah would take bolder steps in the years ahead, but the big change really started with Daydream.",

            "biography": "Mariah Carey (born March 27, 1969 or 1970) is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, and occasional actress. She rose to prominence after releasing her self-titled debut studio album Mariah Carey in 1990; it went multiplatinum and spawned four consecutive number one singles on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. Under the guidance of Columbia Records executive and later husband Tommy Mottola, Carey continued booking success with follow-up albums Emotions (1991), Music Box (1993), and Merry Christmas (1994), and was established as Columbia's highest-selling act. Daydream (1995) made music history when its second single \"One Sweet Day\", a duet with Boyz II Men, spent a record sixteen weeks on top of the Billboard Hot 100, and it remains the longest-running number-one song in U.S. chart history. During the recording of the album, Carey began to deviate from her slower R&B and ballad-oriented beginnings and slowly transitioned into hip hop. This musical change became further established with the release of Butterfly (1997), which was released during the midst of her separation from Mottola.\nCarey left Columbia in 2000, and signed a $100 million recording contract with Virgin Records America. Before the release of her film Glitter (2001), she suffered a physical and emotional breakdown and was hospitalized for severe exhaustion. Following the film and album's poor reception, she was bought out of her recording contract for $50 million, which led to a decline in her career. She signed a multimillion dollar contract deal with Island Records in 2002, and after an unsuccessful period, returned to the top of music charts with The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). Its second single \"We Belong Together\" became her most successful single of the 2000s, and was later named \"Song of the Decade\" by Billboard. Carey once again ventured into film with a well-received supporting role in Precious (2009); she was awarded the \"Breakthrough Performance Award\" at the Palm Springs International Film Festival, and received Black Reel and NAACP Image Award nominations.\nThroughout her career, Carey has sold more than 200 million records worldwide, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time. In 1998, she was honored as the world's best-selling recording artist of the 1990s at the World Music Awards. Carey was also named the best-selling female artist of the millennium in 2000. According to the Recording Industry Association of America, she is the third-best-selling female artist in the United States, with 63.5 million certified albums. With the release of \"Touch My Body\" (2008), Carey gained her 18th number-one single in the United States, more than any other solo artist. In 2012, Carey was ranked second on VH1's list of the \"100 Greatest Women in Music\". Aside from her commercial accomplishments, Carey has won five Grammy Awards, 19 World Music Awards, 11 American Music Awards, and 14 Billboard Music Awards. Referred to as the \"songbird supreme\" by the Guinness World Records, she is famed for her five-octave vocal range, power, melismatic style and signature use of the whistle register.\n\u2191 Thompson, Ben (April 19, 2013). \"Mariah Carey Criticized for Angolan President Performance\".

            "editors_notes": "Celine Dion’s vocal grandeur has made her Barbra Streisand’s natural heir as the supreme female singer in pop. Her sky-high range and nearly-flawless delivery hasn’t always found material to match. Fortunately, Falling Into You (1996) provided her with songs worthy of her abilities. Emotionally-vulnerable lyrics wrapped in heroic melodies are Dion’s particularly forte – on this album, she’s given an outstanding pair of such tunes in \"Because You Loved Me\" (from the film Up Close And Personal) and \"It’s All Coming Back To Me Now\" (written by rock bombast king Jim Steinman). Stepping further into pure pop melodrama, she fully connects with Eric Carmen’s \"All By Myself\" and takes a shot at matching Tina Turner’s fireworks on \"River Deep, Mountain High.\" Beyond these show-stoppers, Fall Into You is notable for its more restrained tunes, such as the balmy, gently-flowing title number and the subdued, slightly unearthly \"Fly.\" Dion’s intimate readings of these and similar tracks will surprise those who only think of her as a belter par excellence. Falling Into You fully solidified Celine’s stature as a worldwide megastar. Grand in design and impeccable in execution, it still captures the essential sweetness of the artist at its center.",

Born into a large family from Charlemagne, Quebec, Dion emerged as a teen star in the French-speaking world after her manager and future husband Ren\u00e9 Ang\u00e9lil mortgaged his home to finance her first record. In 1990, she released the English-language album Unison, establishing herself as a viable pop artist in North America and other English-speaking areas of the world.\nDion first gained international recognition in the 1980s by winning both the 1982 Yamaha World Popular Song Festival and the 1988 Eurovision Song Contest where she represented Switzerland. Following a series of French albums in the early 1980s, she signed on to CBS Records Canada in 1986. During the 1990s, with the help of Ang\u00e9lil, she achieved worldwide fame after signing with Epic Records and releasing several English albums along with additional French albums, becoming one of the most successful artists in pop music history. However, in 1999 at the height of her success, Dion announced a hiatus from entertainment in order to start a family and spend time with her husband, who had been diagnosed with cancer. She returned to the top of pop music in 2002 and signed a three-year (later extended to almost five years) contract to perform nightly in a five-star theatrical show at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace, Paradise, Nevada.\nDion's music has been influenced by genres ranging from rock and R&B to gospel and classical. Her recordings are mainly in French and English, although she also sings in Spanish, Italian, German, Latin, Japanese and Mandarin Chinese. While her releases have often received mixed critical reception, she is renowned for her technically skilled and powerful vocals. Dion has won five Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year for Falling Into You and Record of the Year for \"My Heart Will Go On\". She is the second best-selling female artist in the US during the Nielsen SoundScan era, with her albums Falling Into You and Let's Talk About Love both certified Diamond in the US, In addition, her 1995 album D'eux, is the best-selling French-language album of all time. In 2004, after surpassing 175 million in album sales worldwide, she was presented with the Chopard Diamond Award at the World Music Awards for becoming the best-selling female artist of all time. Dion remains the best-selling Canadian artist in history and one of the best-selling artists of all time with record sales of more than 200 million copies worldwide."

The album is as much a testament to the production of Babyface who, through the mid-1990s, actually was the mainstream of contemporary hit music. Houston's singing is much better than her acting, and almost every song enjoyed a long tenure at the top of all the charts.

In 2009, Guinness World Records cited her as the most awarded female act of all time. Houston is one of pop music's best-selling music artists of all-time, with an estimated 170\u2013200 million records sold worldwide. She released six studio albums, one holiday album and three movie soundtrack albums, all of which have diamond, multi-platinum, platinum or gold certification. Houston's crossover appeal on the popular music charts, as well as her prominence on MTV, starting with her video for \"How Will I Know\", influenced several African American women artists who follow in her footsteps.\nHouston is the only artist to chart seven consecutive No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 hits. She is the second artist behind Elton John and the only woman to have two number-one Billboard 200 Album awards (formerly \"Top Pop Albums\") on the Billboard magazine year-end charts. Houston's 1985 debut album Whitney Houston became the best-selling debut album by a woman in history. Rolling Stone named it the best album of 1986, and ranked it at number 254 on the magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Her second studio album Whitney (1987) became the first album by a woman to debut at number one on the Billboard 200 albums chart.\nHouston's first acting role was as the star of the feature film The Bodyguard (1992). The film's original soundtrack won the 1994 Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Its lead single, \"I Will Always Love You\", became the best-selling single by a woman in music history. With the album, Houston became the first act (solo or group, male or female) to sell more than a million copies of an album within a single week period under Nielsen SoundScan system. The album makes her the top female act in the top 10 list of the best-selling albums of all time, at number four. Houston continued to star in movies and contribute to their soundtracks, including the films Waiting to Exhale (1995) and The Preacher's Wife (1996). The Preacher's Wife soundtrack became the best-selling gospel album in history.\nOn February 11, 2012, Houston was found dead in her guest room at the Beverly Hilton, in Beverly Hills, California. The official coroner's report showed that she had accidentally drowned in the bathtub, with heart disease and cocaine use listed as contributing factors. News of her death coincided with the 2012 Grammy Awards and featured prominently in American and international media."

            "biography": "AC/DC are an Australian hard rock band, formed in November 1973 by brothers Malcolm and Angus Young, who continued as members until Malcolm's illness and departure in 2014. Commonly referred to as a hard rock or blues rock band, they are also considered pioneers of heavy metal and are sometimes classified as such, though they have always dubbed their music as simply \"rock and roll\".\nAC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, High Voltage, on 17 February 1975; Malcolm and Angus were the only original members left in the band. Membership subsequently stabilised until bassist Mark Evans was replaced by Cliff Williams in 1977 for the album Powerage. Within months of recording the album Highway to Hell, lead singer and co-songwriter Bon Scott died on 19 February 1980 after a night of heavy alcohol consumption. The group considered disbanding, but buoyed by support from Scott's parents, decided to continue and set about finding a new vocalist. Ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson was auditioned and selected to replace Scott. Later that year, the band released the new album, Back in Black, which was made as a tribute to Bon Scott. The album launched them to new heights of success and became their all-time best-seller.\nThe band's next album, For Those About to Rock We Salute You, was their first album to reach number one in the United States. AC/DC declined in popularity soon after drummer Phil Rudd was fired in 1983 and was replaced by future Dio drummer Simon Wright. The band experienced a resurgence in the early 1990s with the release of The Razors Edge. Phil Rudd returned in 1994 after Chris Slade, who was with the band from 1989 to 1994, was asked to leave in favour of him, and contributed to the band's 1995 album Ballbreaker. Stiff Upper Lip was released in 2000 and was well received by critics. The band's studio album, Black Ice, was released on 20 October 2008 and was the second-highest-selling album of that year. It was their biggest hit on the charts since For Those About to Rock, eventually reaching No.1 on all charts worldwide. The band's line-up remained the same\u2014their longest unchanged line-up\u2014until 2014 with Malcolm Young's retirement and Rudd's legal troubles.\nAC/DC had sold more than 200 million records worldwide, including 71.5 million albums in the United States alone, making them the tenth-best-selling band in the United States and one of the world's best-selling bands of all time. Back in Black has sold an estimated 50 million units worldwide, making it the fifth-highest-selling album by any artist \u2013 and the third-highest-selling album by any band. The album has sold 22 million units in the US alone, where it is the sixth-highest-selling album of all time. AC/DC ranked fourth on VH1's list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\" and were named the seventh \"Greatest Heavy Metal Band of All Time\" by MTV. In 2004, AC/DC ranked No. 72 on the Rolling Stone list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". Producer Rick Rubin, who wrote an essay on the band for the Rolling Stone list, referred to AC/DC as \"the greatest rock and roll band of all time.\" In 2010, AC/DC were ranked number 23 in the VH1 list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\"."

A Night At The Opera, named after the Marx Bros film, is widely acclaimed as one of the greatest albums of all time. Exceptional on every level, musically, lyrically and artistically, Queen took the strongest elements of their previous two albums to make the ultimate winning combination. The most expensive album ever recorded at that time, it delivered Rock, Opera, Heavy Metal, romance, ballads, Pop, sci-fi Folk, music hall, Trad Jazz and even the National Anthem. The album contains perhaps the most famous Rock song of all time, 'Bohemian Rhapsody', which went on to spend 14 weeks at #1. Queen also recorded the first official Pop promo for 'Bohemian Rhapsody' as they were on tour and could not appear on Top of The Pops and this video paved the way for MTV and VH1. ",

Let It Bleed is a deeply gritty document of the band at a soaring peak—one that came as Mick Jagger and Keith Richards realized that the entire world wasn't necessarily ready to buy into the decade's dream of a greater society. \"Gimmie Shelter\" and \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" were the epics that framed the album and the emotions of characters who'd halfway convinced themselves of endless possibilities. The Stones were hardly backing down musically; these cuts' creativity and heart rivaled what the Beatles were doing in 1969: Hard rock rarely got as brutal as \"Live With Me\" and \"Monkey Man,\" country rock as funny as \"Country Honk\" (a piss-take on \"Honky Tonk Women\"), or as deeply felt as Keith's \"You Got the Silver.\"",

            "biography": "The Rolling Stones are an English rock band formed in London in 1962. The first settled line-up consisted of Brian Jones (guitar, harmonica), Ian Stewart (piano), Mick Jagger (lead vocals, harmonica), Keith Richards (guitar), Bill Wyman (bass) and Charlie Watts (drums). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued as occasional pianist until his death in 1985. Jones departed the band less than a month prior to his death in 1969, having already been replaced by Mick Taylor, who remained until 1975. Subsequently, Ronnie Wood has been on guitar in tandem with Richards. Following Wyman's departure in 1993, Darryl Jones has been the main bassist. Other notable keyboardists for the band have included Nicky Hopkins, active from 1967 to 1982; Billy Preston through the mid 1970s (most prominent on Black and Blue) and Chuck Leavell, active since 1982. The band was first led by Jones but after teaming as the band's songwriters, Jagger and Richards assumed de facto leadership.\nThe Rolling Stones were in the vanguard of the British Invasion of bands that became popular in the US in 1964\u201365. At first noted for their longish hair as much as their music, the band are identified with the youthful and rebellious counterculture of the 1960s. Critic Sean Egan states that within a year of the release of their 1964 debut album, they \"were being perceived by the youth of Britain and then the world as representatives of opposition to an old, cruel order \u2014 the antidote to a class-bound, authoritarian culture.\" They were instrumental in making blues a major part of rock and roll and of changing the international focus of blues culture to the less sophisticated blues typified by Chess Records artists such as Muddy Waters \u2014 writer of \"Rollin' Stone\", after which the band is named. After a short period of musical experimentation that culminated with the poorly received and largely psychedelic album Their Satanic Majesties Request (1967), the group returned to its bluesy roots with Beggars' Banquet (1968) which\u2014along with its follow-ups, Let It Bleed (1969), Sticky Fingers (1971) and Exile on Main St. (1972)\u2014is generally considered to be the band's best work and are considered the Rolling Stones' \"Golden Age\". It was during this period the band were first introduced on stage as \"The World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band\". Musicologist Robert Palmer attributed the \"remarkable endurance\" of the Rolling Stones to being \"rooted in traditional verities, in rhythm-and-blues and soul music\", while \"more ephemeral pop fashions have come and gone\".\nThe band continued to release commercially successful records in the 1970s and sold many albums, with Some Girls (1978) and Tattoo You (1981) being their two most sold albums worldwide. In the 1980s, a feud between Jagger and Richards about the band's musical direction almost caused the band to split but they managed to patch their relationship up and had a big comeback with Steel Wheels (1989), which was followed by a big stadium and arena tour. Since the 1990s, new recorded material from the group has been increasingly less well-received and less frequent. Despite this, the Rolling Stones have continued to be a huge attraction on the live circuit, with big stadium tours in the 1990s and 2000s. By 2007, the band had made what were then four of the top five highest-grossing concert tours of all time (Voodoo Lounge Tour (1994\u201395), Bridges to Babylon Tour (1997\u201399), Licks Tour (2002\u201303) and A Bigger Bang Tour (2005\u201307).\nThe Rolling Stones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004. Rolling Stone magazine ranked them fourth on the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\" list, and their estimated album sales are above 250 million. They have released twenty-nine studio albums, eighteen live albums and numerous compilations. Let It Bleed (1969) was their first of five consecutive number one studio and live albums in the UK. Sticky Fingers (1971) was the first of eight consecutive number one studio albums in the US. In 2008, the band ranked 10th on the Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists chart. In 2012, the band celebrated its 50th anniversary."

            "editors_notes": "If there’s a single definitive ABBA album, it may well be 1977's Arrival: a brilliant synthesis of everything the Swedish foursome did well. The group’s fourth album is at once ambitious and immediately ear-catching, filled with irresistible pop hooks and stirring rhythms. Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus exceed their typically high melodic standards here, whether they’re whipping up frothy Europop (\"When I Kissed the Teacher,\" \"Dum Dum Diddle\"), veering into Teutonic cabaret sounds (\"Money, Money, Money\") or introducing a Celtic folk element (the title tune). Agnetha Faltskog and Frida Lyngstad’s twin lead vocals have plenty of room to shine, especially on richly sculpted ballads like \"My Love, My Life\" and \"Knowing Me, Knowing You.\" Most of all, Arrival is remembered for \"Dancing Queen,\" one of the great pop singles of the '70s, as well as ABBA’s only No. 1 hit in the States. Beyond its individual tracks, Arrival radiates a confidence and joyful spirit that transcends its near-flawless sense of craft. ABBA were sailing high when they made this album, and it shows. (The 2001 reissue adds the band’s Spanish-tinged international hit \"Fernando\" and the breezy B-side \"Happy Hawaii.\")",

            "biography": "ABBA (stylized ) was a Swedish pop group formed in Stockholm in 1972, comprising Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog, Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson, and Anni-Frid Lyngstad. ABBA is an acronym of the first letters of the band members' first names and is sometimes stylized as the registered trademark \u15c5\u15fa\u15f7\u15c5. The band became one of the most commercially successful acts in the history of popular music, topping the charts worldwide from 1975 to 1982. They won the Eurovision Song Contest 1974 at the Dome in Brighton, UK, giving Sweden its first triumph in the contest, and were the most successful group ever to take part in the competition. Ulvaeus and Andersson wrote the Broadway musical \"Chess\" in 1980.\nAccording to CNN and some other sources ABBA has sold over 300 million albums and singles worldwide. Although according to its label the Universal Music Group the band has sold over 375 million records as of January 2010, this figure has not been independently verified and has occasionally been questioned. Other estimates range from over 140 to over 500 million sold records. This makes them one of the best-selling music artists, and the second best-selling music group of all time, after the Beatles. ABBA was the first group to come from a non-English-speaking country to enjoy consistent success in the charts of English-speaking countries, including the UK, Ireland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. The group also enjoyed significant success in Latin American markets, and recorded a collection of their hit songs in Spanish.\n\nDuring the band's active years, F\u00e4ltskog & Ulvaeus and Lyngstad & Andersson were married. At the height of their popularity, both relationships were suffering strain which ultimately resulted in the collapse of the Ulvaeus\u2013F\u00e4ltskog marriage in 1979 and the Andersson\u2013Lyngstad marriage in 1981. These relationship changes were reflected in the group's music, with later compositions including more introspective, brooding, dark lyrics.\nAfter ABBA broke up in late 1982, Andersson and Ulvaeus achieved success writing music for the stage while Lyngstad and F\u00e4ltskog pursued solo careers with mixed success. ABBA's music declined in popularity until several films, notably Muriel's Wedding and The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, revived interest in the group and the spawning of several tribute bands. In 1999, ABBA's music was adapted into the successful musical Mamma Mia! that toured worldwide. A film of the same name, released in 2008, became the highest-grossing film in the United Kingdom that year.\nABBA were honored at the 50th anniversary celebration of the Eurovision Song Contest in 2005, when their hit \"Waterloo\" was chosen as the best song in the competition's history. The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on 15 March 2010."

Born in Saint Michael, Barbados, her career began upon meeting record producer Evan Rogers in late 2003 through mutual friends; she recorded demo tapes with his guidance. Her tape was sent to several record labels, and she subsequently signed a contract with Def Jam Recordings after auditioning for its then-president, hip-hop producer and rapper Jay-Z. Both her debut album, Music of the Sun (2005) and its follow-up A Girl Like Me (2006) peaked in the top ten on the US Billboard 200; the former featured the commercially successful song \"Pon de Replay\" while the latter produced her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one single, \"SOS\".\nShe rose to widespread prominence and became a household name with the release of her third studio album, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007), and its chart-topping lead single \"Umbrella.\" The album and its 2008 Reloaded re-release were nominated for nine Grammy Awards, winning Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"Umbrella\". From 2009 to 2012, following a highly publicized altercation with then-boyfriend, entertainer Chris Brown, she annually released four Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) platinum certified albums: Rated R (2009), Loud (2010), Talk That Talk (2011), and her first Billboard 200 number one album Unapologetic (2012). The same year, she appeared in her first theatrical feature film, Battleship.\nRihanna has sold over 41 million albums and 150 million songs worldwide, making her one of the best-selling artists of all time. Many of her songs rank among the world's best-selling singles of all time, such as \"Umbrella\", \"Take a Bow\", \"Disturbia\", \"Only Girl (In the World)\", \"S&M\", \"We Found Love\", \"Diamonds\" and \"Stay\". In addition to her solo work, Rihanna has collaborated with other artists and was featured on the worldwide hits \"Can't Remember to Forget You\" (with Shakira), \"Live Your Life\" (with T.I.), \"Run This Town\" (with Jay-Z and Kanye West), \"Love the Way You Lie\" and \"The Monster\" (both with Eminem). She has achieved thirteen number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming the youngest and fastest solo artist to accomplish this record. Billboard named her the Digital Songs Artist of the 2000s decade and the top Hot 100 artist of the 2010s decade.\nRihanna is known for frequently reinventing her style and image, most notably since Good Girl Gone Bad. Her work has earned her numerous awards and accolades, including eight Grammy Awards,[1] eight American Music Awards, 23 Billboard Music Awards, and two BRIT Awards. In 2012, Forbes ranked her the fourth most powerful celebrity of the year, with earnings of $53 million between May 2011 and May 2012. The same year, TIME named Rihanna one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World. At the American Music Awards of 2013, she received the first ever Icon Award. On June 2, 2014, Rihanna received the Fashion Icon lifetime achievement award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA)."

He makes his most overt nods yet to rock music, borrowing Aerosmith's \"Dream On\" for the basis of \"Sing for the Moment,\" and gets explicitly political about his job on \"White America\" (\"I could be one of your kids\"). At the same time, he takes himself no more seriously than usual, mocking any hint of grandiosity on \"My Dad's Gone Crazy,\" which invites his beloved daughter Hailie to take funny shots at the old man. \"Superman\" pulls a similar trick not only with the rapper's image, but the macho pose intrinsic to commercial hip-hop.",

            "biography": "Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972), better known by his stage name Eminem, is an American rapper, record producer, and songwriter from Detroit, Michigan. In addition to his solo career, he is a member of D12 and (with Royce da 5'9\") half of the hip-hop duo Bad Meets Evil. Eminem is the best-selling artist of the 2000s in the United States; Rolling Stone ranked him 83rd on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, calling him the King of Hip Hop. Including his work with D12 and Bad Meets Evil, Eminem has had ten number-one albums on the Billboard 200. He has sold more than 155 million albums and singles, making him one of the world's best-selling artists. As of June 2014, Eminem is the second-bestselling male artist of the Nielsen SoundScan era, the sixth-bestselling artist in the United States and the bestselling hip-hop artist, with sales of 45,160,000 albums and 31 million digital singles.\nAfter his debut album Infinite (1996), Eminem achieved mainstream popularity in 1999 with The Slim Shady LP; the commercially successful second album received his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. His next two releases (2000's The Marshall Mathers LP and 2002's The Eminem Show) were worldwide successes, with each certified diamond in US sales. Both won Best Rap Album Grammy Awards, making Eminem the first artist to win the award for three consecutive LPs. They were followed by Encore in 2004, another critical and commercial success. Eminem went on hiatus after touring in 2005, releasing Relapse in 2009 and Recovery in 2010; both won Grammy Awards. Recovery was the bestselling album of 2010 worldwide, and the rapper's second international bestselling album of the year (his first was The Eminem Show). Eminem's eighth album (2013's The Marshall Mathers LP 2) won two Grammy Awards, including Best Rap Album; it expanded his record for the most wins in that category and his Grammy total to 15.\nEminem has developed other ventures, including Shady Records with manager Paul Rosenberg. He has his own channel, Shade 45, on Sirius XM Radio. In November 2002, Eminem starred in the hip hop film 8 Mile. He won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"Lose Yourself\", the first rap artist to win the award. Eminem has made cameo appearances in the films The Wash (2001), Funny People (2009), The Interview (2014) and the television series Entourage."

            "editors_notes": "George Jones moved to MCA Records in 1990, beginning the decade with the promising And Along Came Jones. As it turns out, a new label and a new band of collaborators and producers didn't necessarily mean artistic revitalization for Jones. He still could turn out some fine records, but he often fell prey to formula, particularly in how he always seemed to have a song about how he \"don't need your rocking chair\" or how country radio won't play veterans like him. Even if those sentiments may be true, they gave all the albums a homogenous feel, which in turn led to less airplay. So, when Jones left MCA for Elektra and it was time for a compilation of MCA material, there weren't many hits for a compilation. Then again, George Jones Collection isn't really a hits compilation, it's a portrait of the MCA years, which were scattershot in terms of quality and remarkably consistent in tone. Accordingly, the 11-track compilation is coherent but uneven, containing some great moments (\"Walls Can Fall,\" \"Wrong's What I Do Best,\" \"You Couldn't Get the Picture\") and a number of mediocrities. This may mean that it's an accurate portrait of this era, but it doesn't mean that it contains all the best moments from his MCA recordings, which will undoubtedly be frustrating for serious fans that want a definitive compilation of Jones' latter-day recordings",

            "biography": "Troyal Garth Brooks (born February 7, 1962), best known as Garth Brooks, is an American country music singer-songwriter. His eponymous first album was released in 1989 and peaked at number 2 in the US country album chart while climbing to number 13 on the Billboard 200 album chart. Brooks' integration of rock elements into his recordings and live performances earned him immense popularity. This progressive approach allowed him to dominate the country single and album charts while crossing over into the mainstream pop arena.\nBrooks broke records for both sales and concert attendance throughout the 1990s. As of 2013, his recordings continue to sell well and, according to Nielsen Soundscan, his albums sales up to May 2013 are 68,630,000, which makes him the best-selling albums artist in the United States in the SoundScan era (since 1991), a title held since 1991, well over 5 million ahead of his nearest rival, the Beatles. According to RIAA he is the second best-selling solo albums artist in the United States of all time ahead of Elvis Presley (second to the Beatles) with 135 million units sold. Brooks is one of the world's best-selling artists of all time, having sold more than 150 million records.\nBrooks has released six albums that achieved diamond status in the United States, those being: Garth Brooks (10\u00d7 platinum), No Fences (17\u00d7 platinum), Ropin' the Wind (14\u00d7 platinum), The Hits (10\u00d7 platinum), Sevens (10\u00d7 platinum) and Double Live (21\u00d7 platinum). Since 1989, Brooks has released 20 records in all, which include; 10 studio albums, 1 live album, 3 compilation albums, 3 Christmas albums and 3 box sets, along with 77 singles. He won several important awards in his career, including 2 Grammy Awards, 17 American Music Awards (including the \"Artist of the '90s\") and the RIAA Award as Best selling solo albums artist of the Century in the United States.\nTroubled by conflicts between career and family, Brooks officially retired from recording and performing from 2001 until 2009. During this time, he sold millions of albums through an exclusive distribution deal with Walmart and sporadically released new singles. In 2005, Brooks started a partial comeback, and has since given several performances and released two compilation albums.\nOn October 15, 2009, Garth Brooks announced the end of his retirement. In December 2009, he began a five-year concert deal with the Encore Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. Following the conclusion of his residency in Las Vegas, Brooks announced his signing with Sony Music Nashville in July 2014. In September 2014, he began his comeback world tour. His most recent album, Man Against Machine, was released on November 11, 2014 via his new online music store GhostTunes.\nBrooks was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame on October 21, 2012."

From Bono’s anguished cries from Mount Olympus and the Edge’s serrated guitar riffs to the rhythm section’s punishing marches and the Brian Eno-Daniel Lanois production team’s desert atmospherics, the album presented some of the band’s most memorable material in its most drastic form to date, assimilating the band’s initial post-punk energy with their fascination and immersion in American roots music. \"With or Without You,\" \"Where the Streets Have No Name,\" \"I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For,\" and especially the often overlooked \"Running to Stand Still\" shimmer with intensity, nuance and elegant style. The 2007 re-mastered and expanded edition includes 14 additional glimpses at the group during this creatively fertile time, including the single edit of \"Streets,\" the Sun City version of \"Silver and Gold\" with the Rolling Stones’ Keith Richards and Ron Wood, several notable fan faves such as \"Luminous Times (Hold On to Love)\" and \"Spanish Eyes\" and a few improvisatory pieces (\"Drunk Chicken/ America\" with beat poet Allen Ginsberg) that provide insight into the band’s creative process.

Formed in 1976, the group consists of Bono (vocals and guitar), The Edge (guitar, keyboards, and vocals), Adam Clayton (bass guitar), and Larry Mullen, Jr. (drums and percussion). U2's early sound was rooted in post-punk but eventually grew to incorporate influences from many genres of popular music. Throughout the group's musical pursuits, they have maintained a sound built on melodic instrumentals. Their lyrics, often embellished with spiritual imagery, focus on personal themes and sociopolitical concerns.\nThe band formed at Mount Temple Comprehensive School in 1976 when the members were teenagers with limited musical proficiency. Within four years, they signed with Island Records and released their debut album Boy. By the mid-1980s, U2 had become a top international act. They were more successful as a touring act than they were at selling records until their 1987 album The Joshua Tree which, according to Rolling Stone, elevated the band's stature \"from heroes to superstars\". Reacting to musical stagnation and criticism of their earnest image and musical direction in the late-1980s, U2 reinvented themselves with their 1991 album, Achtung Baby, and the accompanying Zoo TV Tour; they integrated dance, industrial, and alternative rock influences into their sound, and embraced a more ironic and self-deprecating image. They embraced similar experimentation for the remainder of the 1990s with varying levels of success. U2 regained critical and commercial favour in the 2000s with the records All That You Can't Leave Behind (2000) and How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb (2004), which established a more conventional, mainstream sound for the group. Their U2 360\u00b0 Tour from 2009\u20132011 was the highest-attended and highest-grossing concert tour in history.\nU2 have released 13 studio albums and are one of the world's best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 170 million records worldwide. They have won 22 Grammy Awards, more than any other band; and, in 2005, were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility. Rolling Stone ranked U2 at number 22 in its list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\", and labelled them the \"Biggest Band in the World\". Throughout their career, as a band and as individuals, they have campaigned for human rights and philanthropic causes, including Amnesty International, the ONE/DATA campaigns, Product Red, and The Edge's Music Rising."

While \"Piano Man\" and \"Captain Jack\" are fully realized Joel tunes that sound like the man everyone knows, tracks like \"Travelin’ Prayer,\" \"Ain’t No Crime,\" and \"The Ballad of Billy the Kid\" sound like early-‘70s singer/songwriter productions heavily influenced by Elton John. Joel’s inventive melodies, though, established him as a potential star. This legacy edition includes a live radio concert from Philadelphia’s WMMR on April 15, 1972. It’s the show that landed Joel his label contract. The future hit \"She’s Got a Way\" is here, along with passionate takes on \"Captain Jack,\" \"Everybody Loves You Now,\" and \"The Ballad of Billy the Kid.\" Three tracks, the bar-band rocker \"Josephine,\" the ballad \"Long, Long Time,\" and the compelling portrait \"Rosalinda\" (not \"Rosalinda’s Eyes\"), complete this amazing concert.",

            "editors_notes": "Face Value, Phil Collins’ 1981 solo debut, wasn't predicted to be the massive crossover smash that it eventually became. Having spent the duration of the '70s as the drummer and singer in Genesis, Collins spent late 1979 nursing the wounds of a nasty divorce in the confines of his English mansion. Using the then-brand-new Prophet-5 synthesizer and a Roland CR-78 drum machine, Collins channeled his vindictiveness and despair into a new set of demos that he never thought would become an album. But when his record label got wind of the music, Collins was persuaded to develop those demos into what became Face Value. With its minimalistic electronics and brooding atmosphere, \"In the Air Tonight\" set the album's tone. Amazingly, it also became its breakout single—surely among the most menacing songs to became a pop hit. Notwithstanding a few avant-garde–tinged moments (like the beautiful Steve Reich homage \"Droned\"), the rest of the album is as much a work of R&B as rock ‘n’ roll. Among the standouts are \"This Must Be Love,\" \"I Missed Again,\" and \"I’m Not Moving.\"",

            "biography": "Philip David Charles \"Phil\" Collins, LVO (born 30 January 1951), is an English singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, music producer and actor. He gained fame as both the drummer and lead singer for the rock band Genesis, and he also gained worldwide fame as a solo artist.\nCollins is one of the most successful songwriters and performers of all time, singing the lead vocals on dozens of hit albums and singles in the UK and the US between 1976 and 2010, either as a solo artist or with Genesis. His solo singles, sometimes dealing with lost love and often featuring his distinctive gated reverb drum sound, ranged from the atmospheric \"In the Air Tonight\", dance-rock of \"Sussudio\", piano-driven power ballad \"Against All Odds\", to the political and religious connotations of \"Another Day in Paradise\". Collins has been described by AllMusic as \"one of the most successful pop and adult contemporary singers of the '80s and beyond\".\nCollins joined Genesis in 1970 as the group's drummer and became their lead vocalist in 1975 following the departure of the original lead singer Peter Gabriel. His solo career, which was launched in 1981 and was heavily influenced by his personal life and soul music, brought both himself and Genesis greater commercial success. Collins's total worldwide sales as a solo artist are 150 million. Collins has won numerous music awards throughout his career, including seven Grammy Awards, six Brit Awards\u2014winning Best British Male three times, three American Music Awards, an Academy Award, two Golden Globe Awards and a Disney Legend Award in 2002 for his solo work. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1999, was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003, and into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Genesis in 2010. Collins was ranked number 10 in \"The Greatest Drummers of All Time\" list by Gigwise and number nine in a list of \"The 20 greatest drummers of the last 25 years\" by MusicRadar in 2010.\nCollins is one of only three recording artists (along with Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson) who have sold over 100 million albums worldwide both as solo artists and (separately) as principal members of a band. During his most successful period as a solo artist between 1981 and 1990, Collins had three UK number-one singles and seven number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, as well as a U.S. number one with Genesis in 1986. When his work with Genesis, his work with other artists, as well as his solo career is totalled, Collins had more top 40 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart during the 1980s than any other artist. In 2008, Collins was ranked the 22nd most successful artist on the \"Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists\". Although one of the world's best-selling recording artists and a highly respected drummer, Collins has garnered significant criticism over the years from music journalists and fellow artists. He announced his retirement in 2011 to focus on his family life, though he continued to write songs and in 2013 he said he was considering a return to the music industry."

            "biography": "Aerosmith is an American rock band, sometimes referred to as \"the Bad Boys from Boston\" and \"America's Greatest Rock and Roll Band.\" Their style, which is rooted in blues-based hard rock, has come to also incorporate elements of pop, heavy metal, and rhythm and blues, and has inspired many subsequent rock artists. The band was formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1970. Guitarist Joe Perry and bassist Tom Hamilton, originally in a band together called the Jam Band, met up with vocalist/pianist/harmonicist Steven Tyler, drummer Joey Kramer, and guitarist Ray Tabano, and formed Aerosmith. In 1971, Tabano was replaced by Brad Whitford, and the band began developing a following in Boston.\nThey were signed to Columbia Records in 1972, and released a string of gold and platinum albums, beginning with their 1973 eponymous debut album, followed by their 1974 album Get Your Wings. In 1975, the band broke into the mainstream with the album Toys in the Attic, and their 1976 follow-up Rocks cemented their status as hard rock superstars. Two additional albums followed in 1977 and 1979. The band's first five albums have since attained multi-platinum status. Throughout the 1970s, the band toured extensively and charted a dozen Hot 100 singles. By the end of the decade, they were among the most popular hard rock bands in the world and developed a loyal following of fans, often referred to as the \"Blue Army\". However, drug addiction and internal conflict took their toll on the band, which resulted in the departures of Perry and Whitford in 1979 and 1981, respectively; they were replaced by Jimmy Crespo and Rick Dufay. The band did not fare well between 1980 and 1984, releasing the album Rock in a Hard Place, which went gold but failed to match their previous successes.\nPerry and Whitford returned in 1984 and the band signed a new deal with Geffen Records. After a comeback tour, the band recorded Done with Mirrors (1985), which won some critical praise but failed to come close to commercial expectations. It was not until the band's collaboration with rap group Run\u2013D.M.C. in 1986, and the 1987 multi-platinum release Permanent Vacation, that they regained the level of popularity they had experienced in the 1970s. In the late 1980s and 1990s, the band scored several hits and won numerous awards for music from the multi-platinum albums Pump (1989), Get a Grip (1993), and Nine Lives (1997), and embarked on their most extensive concert tours to date. The band also became a pop culture phenomenon with popular music videos and notable appearances in television, film, and video games. Their comeback has been described as one of the most remarkable and spectacular in rock 'n' roll history. Additional albums followed in 2001, 2004, and 2012. Since 2001, the band has toured every year except 2008. After 45 years of performing, the band continues to tour and record music.\nAerosmith is the best-selling American rock band of all time, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide, including over 70 million records in the United States alone. With 25 gold albums, 18 platinum albums, and 12 multi-platinum albums, they hold the record for the most gold albums by an American group, the most total certifications by an American group, and are tied for the most multi-platinum albums by an American group. The band has scored 21 Top 40 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, nine number-one Mainstream Rock hits, four Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, and ten MTV Video Music Awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, and were included among both Rolling Stone's and VH1's lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. In 2013, the band's principal songwriters, Tyler and Perry, were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame."

            "editors_notes": "Constructed around a light-hearted travel theme, Come Fly With Me, Frank Sinatra's first project with arranger Billy May, was a breezy change of pace from the somber Where Are You. From the first swinging notes of Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen's \"Come Fly With Me\" — which is written at Sinatra's request — it's clear that the music on the collection is intended to be fun. Over the course of the album, Sinatra and May travel around the world in song, performing standards like \"Moonlight in Vermont\" and \"April in Paris,\" as well as humorous tunes like \"Isle of Capri\" and \"On the Road to Mandalay.\" May's signature bold, brassy arrangements give these songs a playful, carefree, nearly sarcastic feel, but never is the approach less than affectionate. In fact, Come Fly With Me is filled with varying moods and textures, as it moves from boisterous swing numbers to romantic ballads, and hitting any number of emotions in between. There may be greater albums in Sinatra's catalog, but few are quite as fun as Come Fly With Me. ",

            "biography": "Francis Albert \"Frank\" Sinatra (/s\u0268\u02c8n\u0251\u02d0tr\u0259/; December 12, 1915 \u2013 May 14, 1998) was an American singer, actor, director, and producer.\nBeginning his musical career in the swing era as a boy singer with Harry James and Tommy Dorsey, Sinatra found success as a solo artist from the early to mid-1940s after being signed by Columbia Records in 1943. Being the idol of the \"bobby soxers\", he released his first album, The Voice of Frank Sinatra, in 1946. His professional career had stalled by the early 1950s, but it was reborn in 1953 after he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in From Here to Eternity. He signed with Capitol Records in 1953 and released several critically lauded albums (such as In the Wee Small Hours, Songs for Swingin' Lovers!, Come Fly with Me, Only the Lonely and Nice 'n' Easy). Sinatra left Capitol to found his own record label, Reprise Records in 1961 (finding success with albums such as Ring-a-Ding-Ding!, Sinatra at the Sands and Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim), toured internationally, was a founding member of the Rat Pack and fraternized with celebrities and statesmen, including John F. Kennedy.\nSinatra turned 50 in 1965, recorded the retrospective September of My Years, starred in the Emmy-winning television special Frank Sinatra: A Man and His Music, and scored hits with \"Strangers in the Night\" and \"My Way\". In 1967, he recorded one of his most famous collaborations with Tom Jobim, the album \"Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim\" which was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. It was followed by 1968's collaboration with Duke Ellington. With sales of his music dwindling and after appearing in several poorly received films, Sinatra retired for the first time in 1971. Two years later, however, he came out of retirement and from 1973 recorded several albums, scoring a Top 40 hit with \"(Theme From) New York, New York\" in 1980. Using his Las Vegas shows as a home base, he toured both within the United States and internationally, until a short time before his death in 1998. Sinatra also forged a highly successful career as a film actor. After winning Best Supporting Actor in 1953, he also garnered a nomination for Best Actor for The Man with the Golden Arm (1955), and critical acclaim for his performance in The Manchurian Candidate (1962). He also starred in such musicals as On the Town (1949), Guys and Dolls (1955), High Society (1956), and Pal Joey (1957).\nSinatra is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide. He was honored at the Kennedy Center Honors in 1983 and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Ronald Reagan in 1985 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1997. Sinatra was also the recipient of eleven Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Trustees Award, Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. One of the most popular and influential musical artists of the 20th century, Sinatra had a popularity that was later matched only by Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and Michael Jackson. American music critic Robert Christgau called him \"the greatest singer of the 20th century\"."

The album was written and produced by Barry Gibb in association with his brothers and the producers of the Bee Gees, and in essence it sounds like a post-Saturday Night Fever Bee Gees album with vocals by Streisand. Gibb adapted his usual style somewhat, especially in slowing the tempos and leaving more room for the vocal, but his melodic style and the backup vocals, even when they are not sung by the Bee Gees, are typical of them. Still, the record was more hybrid than compromise, and the chart-topping single \"Woman in Love\" has a sinuous feel that is both right for Streisand and new for her. Other hits were the title song and \"What Kind of Fool,\" both duets with Gibb. (The song \"Guilty\" won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal by Duo or Group.) ",

            "biography": "Barbra Joan Streisand (born Barbara Joan Streisand; April 24, 1942) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and filmmaker. During a career spanning six decades, she has become an icon in multiple fields of entertainment, winning numerous awards, which has earned her recognition as Mother of All Contemporary Pop Divas or Queen of The Divas. She has been recognized with two Academy Awards, ten Grammy Awards including the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and the Grammy Legend Award, five Emmy Awards including one Daytime Emmy, a Special Tony Award, an American Film Institute award, a Kennedy Center Honors prize, four Peabody Awards, and eleven Golden Globes. She is among a select group of entertainers who have been honored with all the major industry prizes.\nStreisand is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with more than 72.5 million albums in the United States and with a total of 245 million records sold worldwide, making her the best-selling female artist among the top-selling artists recognized by the Recording Industry Association of America. (The only female in the top ten, and the only artist outside of the rock 'n' roll genre.)\nAfter beginning a successful recording career in the 1960s, Streisand ventured into film by the end of the decade. She starred in the critically acclaimed Funny Girl, for which she won the Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Actress. Her other films include The Owl and the Pussycat, The Way We Were, and A Star Is Born, for which she received her second Academy Award, composing music for the love theme \"Evergreen\", the first woman to be honored as a composer. With the release of Yentl in 1983, Streisand established herself as one of the film industry\u2019s most notable figures by becoming the first woman to write, produce, direct, and star in a major studio film. The film won an Oscar for Best Score and Best Motion Picture Musical; Streisand received the Golden Globe Award for Best Director, the first (and to date only) woman to win that award.\nThe RIAA and Billboard recognize Streisand as holding the record for the most top-ten albums of any female recording artist: a total of 33 since 1963. Streisand is the only recording artist to have a number-one album in each of the last six decades, having released 53 Gold albums, 31 Platinum albums, and 14 Multi-Platinum albums in the United States."

            "editors_notes": "Although he managed to place three singles in the charts after joining Uni Records in 1968, Neil Diamond did not achieve a real hit record on the label until March 1969, when his fourth Uni single, \"Brother Love's Traveling Salvation Show,\" got into the Top 40. Naturally, Diamond quickly assembled an album to support the single, and it was released the following month. On it, the singer/songwriter to a certain extent followed the lead of the gospel-tinged hit, a tribute to a rural evangelist, by giving a country feel to the arrangements of such songs as \"Long Gone,\" \"Glory Road,\" and even the novelty \"You're So Sweet, Horseflies Keep Hangin' 'Round Your Face,\" which, with lines like \"You're more loyal than my dog Sam/And twice as pretty,\" was really a country parody. At times, the album betrayed the speed with which it had been put together, with songs like \"Dig In\" and \"River Runs, New Grown Plums\" coming off more as unfinished sketches than developed compositions. Diamond seemed to write on the guitar, and sometimes his up-tempo numbers didn't get much beyond the stage of being basic rhythmic strums, a rudimentary melody, and a few catch phrases. (The arrangers tried to hide this sketchiness behind strings, horns, and female choruses.) His ballads seemed more considered, making songs like \"And the Grass Won't Pay No Mind\" (a Top 40 hit for Mark Lindsay in 1970) the album's strongest. But Diamond may have been aware that the material was mostly second-rate. Normally, Uni would have been expected to pull another couple of songs as singles, but instead Diamond quickly delivered a new single, \"Sweet Caroline,\" within two months of the LP's appearance. When that song became a breakout Top Five hit, Uni added it to later pressings of the album. ",

In the case of The Bee Gees, studying their biggest chart successes is an intriguing way to track the trio's artistic evolution. On their '60s smashes, the Gibb brothers married their flair for fetching pop hooks with a lyrical sensibility that could turn dark, and on such tunes as \"I Started a Joke\" and \"I've Gotta Get a Message to You,\" things get downright macabre, making for some simultaneously lilting and unsettling hit singles. In the '70s, they started amping up the R&B influence with the likes of \"How Can You Mend a Broken Heart\" and \"Jive Talkin'\" before emerging as definitive disco kings with \"Stayin' Alive,\" \"Night Fever,\" et al. Later, gilded, synth-soaked production pushed \"You Win Again\" to the charts' upper rungs. Here, bonus tracks include the group's own versions of No. 1 hits they wrote for others: \"Islands in the Stream\" (made famous by Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton) and \"Immortality,\" best known via Celine Dion.",

            "biography": "The Bee Gees were a pop music group formed in 1958. The group's line-up consisted of brothers Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb. The trio were successful for most of their decades of recording music, but they had two distinct periods of exceptional success: as a popular music act in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and as prominent performers of the disco music era in the late 1970s. The group sang recognisable three-part tight harmonies; Robin's clear vibrato lead vocals were a hallmark of their earlier hits, while Barry's R&B falsetto became their signature sound during the late 1970s and 1980s. They wrote all of their own hits, as well as writing and producing several major hits for other artists.\nBorn on the Isle of Man to English parents, the Gibb brothers lived in Chorlton, Manchester, England, until the late 1950s, and formed the Rattlesnakes. The family then moved to Redcliffe, in Queensland, Australia, and then to Cribb Island. After achieving their first chart success in Australia as the Bee Gees with \"Spicks and Specks\" (their 12th single), they returned to the UK in January 1967 where producer Robert Stigwood began promoting them to a worldwide audience.\nThe Bee Gees have sold more than 220 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists of all time. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997; the presenter of the award to \"Britain's first family of harmony\" was Brian Wilson, historical leader of the Beach Boys, a \"family act\" also featuring three harmonising brothers. The Bee Gees' Hall of Fame citation says \"Only Elvis Presley, the Beatles, Michael Jackson, Garth Brooks and Paul McCartney have outsold the Bee Gees.\"\nFollowing Maurice's sudden death in January 2003 at the age of 53, Barry and Robin retired the group's name after 45 years of activity. In 2009 Robin announced that he and Barry had agreed that the Bee Gees would re-form and perform again. Robin died in May 2012 at the age of 62, after a prolonged struggle with cancer and other health problems, leaving Barry as the lone surviving member of the group."

Cale, British pub-rock and sober, judicious instrumentation. Their sense of economy sounded incredibly straight-laced in the face of punk’s anarchic attack. Yet, it’s exactly this refusal to pay attention to current fads and styles that make Dire Straits’ debut album such a singular and timeless achievement. Mark Knopfler was a flawless guitar-picker, turning country influences into jazz runs and embracing the \"folk\" in his rock. \"Sultans of Swing\" was, deservedly, the hit, with its impossible to ignore finger-tapping gallop, but \"Water of Love,\" \"Down to the Waterline\" and \"Wild West End\" held somber, engrossing vibes that weren’t easily ignored as well. \"Setting Me Up\" and \"Southbound Again\" serve up rockabilly with a Stones-like pulse. \"Six Blade Knife\" re-imagines Fleetwood Mac’s Stevie Nicks’ ballads with a cynical menace hiding in the alleyway outside. \"In the Gallery\" casts Knopfler as an accomplished student of Ry Cooder.",

Dire Straits' sound drew from a variety of musical influences, including jazz, folk, and blues, and came closest to beat music within the context of rock and roll. Despite the prominence of punk rock during the band's early years, the band's stripped-down sound contrasted with punk, demonstrating a more \"rootsy\" influence that emerged from pub rock. Many of Dire Straits' compositions were melancholic. Dire Straits' biggest selling album, Brothers in Arms, has sold over 30 million copies, and was the first album to sell a million copies on CD.\nThey also became one of the world's most commercially successful bands, with worldwide album sales of over 120 million. Dire Straits won four Grammy Awards, three Brit Awards\u2014winning Best British Group twice, two MTV Video Music Awards, and various other music awards. The band's songs include \"Money for Nothing\", \"Sultans of Swing\", \"So Far Away\", \"Walk of Life\", \"Brothers in Arms\", \"Private Investigations\", \"Romeo and Juliet\", \"Tunnel of Love\", and \"Telegraph Road\".\nAccording to the Guinness Book of British Hit Albums, Dire Straits have spent over 1,100 weeks on the UK albums chart, ranking fifth all-time. Their career spanned a combined total of 15 years. They originally split up in 1988, but reformed in 1991, and disbanded for good in 1995 when Mark Knopfler launched his career full-time as a solo artist. There were several changes in personnel over both periods, leaving Mark Knopfler and John Illsley as the only two original bandmates who had remained throughout the band's career."

            "biography": "Metallica is an American heavy metal band formed in Los Angeles, California. Metallica was formed in 1981 when vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield responded to an advertisement posted by drummer Lars Ulrich in a local newspaper. The band's current line-up comprises founding members Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo. Lead guitarist Dave Mustaine and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted are former members of the band. Metallica collaborated over a long period with producer Bob Rock, who produced all of the band's albums from 1990 to 2003 and served as a temporary bassist between the departure of Newsted and the hiring of Trujillo.\nThe band's fast tempos, instrumentals, and aggressive musicianship placed them as one of the founding \"big four\" bands of thrash metal, alongside Anthrax, Megadeth, and Slayer. The band earned a growing fan base in the underground music community and won critical acclaim with its first four albums; the third album Master of Puppets (1986) was described as one of the most influential and heaviest thrash metal albums. Metallica achieved substantial commercial success with its eponymous fifth album\u2014also known as The Black Album\u2014which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. With this release the band expanded its musical direction, resulting in an album that appealed to a more mainstream audience. In 2000, Metallica was among a number of artists who filed a lawsuit against Napster for sharing the band's copyright-protected material for free without consent from any band member. A settlement was reached and Napster became a pay-to-use service. Despite reaching number one on the Billboard 200, the release of St. Anger (2003) alienated many fans with the exclusion of guitar solos and the \"steel-sounding\" snare drum. A film titled Some Kind of Monster documented the recording of St. Anger and the tensions within the band during that time. In 2009, Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\nMetallica has released nine studio albums, four live albums, five extended plays, 26 music videos, and 37 singles. The band has won eight Grammy Awards and five of its albums have consecutively debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. The band's eponymous 1991 album has sold over 16 million copies in the United States, making it the best-selling album of the SoundScan Era. Metallica ranks as one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, having sold over 110 million records worldwide. Metallica has been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by many magazines, including Rolling Stone, which ranked them 61st on its list of The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. As of December 2012, Metallica is the third best-selling music artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991, selling a total of 54.26 million albums in the United States. In 2012, Metallica formed the independent record label Blackened Recordings and took full ownership of its albums and videos. As of 2015, the band is in production of its tenth studio album, slated to be released later in the year."

            "editors_notes": "Slippery When Wet wasn't just a breakthrough album for Bon Jovi; it was a breakthrough for hair metal in general, marking the point where the genre officially entered the mainstream. Released in 1986, it presented a streamlined combination of pop, hard rock, and metal that appealed to everyone — especially girls, whom traditional heavy metal often ignored. Slippery When Wet was more indebted to pop than metal, though, and the band made no attempt to hide its commercial ambition, even hiring an outside songwriter to co-write two of the album's biggest singles. The trick paid off as Slippery When Wet became the best-selling album of 1987, beating out contenders like Appetite for Destruction, The Joshua Tree, and Michael Jackson's Bad. Part of the album's success could be attributed to Desmond Child, a behind-the-scenes songwriter who went on to write hits for Aerosmith, Michael Bolton, and Ricky Martin. With Child's help, Bon Jovi penned a pair of songs that would eventually define their career — \"Living on a Prayer\" and \"You Give Love a Bad Name\" — two teenage anthems that mixed Springsteen's blue-collar narratives with straightforward, guitar-driven hooks. The band's characters may have been down on their luck — they worked dead-end jobs, pined for dangerous women, and occasionally rode steel horses — but Bon Jovi never presented a problem that couldn’t be cured by a good chorus, every one of which seemed to celebrate a glass-half-full mentality. Elsewhere, the group turned to nostalgia, using songs like \"Never Say Goodbye\" and \"Wild in the Streets\" to re-create (or fabricate) an untamed, sex-filled youth that undoubtedly appealed to the band’s teen audience. Bon Jovi wasn't nearly as hard-edged as Mötley Crüe or technically proficient as Van Halen, but the guys smartly played to their strengths, shunning the extremes for an accessible, middle-of-the-road approach that wound up appealing to more fans than most of their peers. \"It’s alright if you have a good time,\" Jon Bon Jovi sang on Slippery When Wet’s first track, \"Let It Rock,\" and those words essentially served as a mantra for the entire hair metal genre, whose carefree, party-heavy attitude became the soundtrack for the rest of the ‘80s.",

            "biography": "Bon Jovi is an American rock band from Sayreville, New Jersey. Formed in 1983, Bon Jovi consists of lead singer and namesake Jon Bon Jovi (born John Francis Bongiovi, Jr.), pianist and keyboard player David Bryan, and drummer Tico Torres. The band's lineup has remained mostly static during its history, with the only exceptions being the 1994 dismissal of bass player Alec John Such, who was unofficially replaced by Hugh McDonald, and the departure of longtime guitarist and co-songwriter Richie Sambora in 2013. In 1986, Bon Jovi achieved widespread global recognition with their third album, Slippery When Wet. The band's fourth album, New Jersey was equally successful in 1988. After touring and recording non-stop during the late 1980s, the band went on hiatus following the New Jersey Tour in 1990, during which time Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora both released successful solo albums. In 1992, the band returned with the album Keep the Faith. Their 2000 single \"It's My Life\", which followed a second hiatus, successfully introduced the band to a younger audience. Bon Jovi have been known to use different styles in their music, which has included country for their 2007 album Lost Highway. On March 12, 2013, Bon Jovi released their 12th studio album, What About Now.\nThus far, Bon Jovi has released 12 studio albums, plus two compilations and two live albums. They are one of the world\u2019s best-selling bands of all time, having sold more than 100 million records worldwide and performed more than 2,700 concerts in over 50 countries for more than 34 million fans. Bon Jovi was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006. The band was also honored with the Award of Merit at the American Music Awards in 2004, and as songwriters and collaborators, Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora were inducted into Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2009."

            "biography": "Britney Jean Spears (born December 2, 1981) is an American singer and actress. Born in McComb, Mississippi, and raised in Kentwood, Louisiana, she performed acting roles in stage productions and television shows as a child before signing with Jive Records in 1997. Spears's first and second studio albums, ...Baby One More Time (1999) and Oops!... I Did It Again (2000), became international successes, with the former becoming the best-selling album by a teenage solo artist. Title tracks \"...Baby One More Time\" and \"Oops!... I Did It Again\" broke international sales records. In 2001, Spears released her self-titled third studio album, Britney, and played the starring role in the film Crossroads (2002). She assumed creative control of her fourth studio album, In the Zone (2003), which yielded the worldwide success of the \"Toxic\" single.\nIn 2007, Spears's much-publicized personal issues sent her career into hiatus. Her fifth studio album, Blackout, was released later that year, and spawned hits such as \"Gimme More\" and \"Piece of Me\". Her erratic behavior and hospitalizations continued through the following year, at which point she was placed under a still on-going conservatorship. Spears's sixth studio album, Circus (2008), included global chart-topping lead single \"Womanizer\". Its supporting tour The Circus Starring Britney Spears was one of the highest-grossing global concert tours in 2009. Later that October, \"3\" became Spears's third single to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Her seventh studio album, Femme Fatale (2011), became her first to yield three top-ten singles in the United States: \"Hold It Against Me\", \"Till the World Ends\" and \"I Wanna Go\". She also served as a judge during the second season of the American version of The X Factor. Spears's eponymous eighth studio album Britney Jean was released in 2013; it spawned the top 15 hit \"Work Bitch\", however it became the lowest-selling record of her career. Later that year, Spears began the two-year residency show Britney: Piece of Me at The AXIS at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino in Las Vegas.\nSpears was established as a pop icon and credited with influencing the revival of teen pop during the late 1990s. She became the 'best-selling teenaged artist of all time' and garnered honorific titles including the \"Princess of Pop\". Her work has earned her numerous awards and accolades, including a Grammy Award, six MTV Video Music Awards including the Lifetime Achievement Award, nine Billboard Music Awards, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2009, Billboard ranked her as the 8th overall Artist of the Decade, and also recognized her as the best-selling female artist of the 2000s, as well as the fifth overall. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) named Spears as the eighth top-selling female artist in the United States, with 34 million certified albums. She has sold over 100 million albums worldwide and over 100 million singles, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time. Rolling Stone recognized her instant success as one of the Top 25 Teen Idol Breakout Moments of all time, while VH1 ranked her eleventh on their \"100 Greatest Women in Music\" list in 2012, and Billboard named her the sexiest woman in music. Forbes reported that Spears was the highest paid female musician of 2012, with earnings of $58 million, having last topped the list in 2002.\n\u2191 Folkard, Claire (2003).

            "editors_notes": "\"Da Ya Think I’m Sexy?\" dominates this album as its colossal hit and singular surefire stunner — 1979’s number one — as it’s a perfect blend of rock and disco. Rod Stewart was continuing his career shift into slicker, sleeker terrain. His voice was still carrying great effect and while the songs are shamelessly tacky, \"Dirty Weekend,\" \"Attractive Female Wanted,\" \"Ain’t Love A Bitch,\" and the title track aren’t without their guilty pleasures. They use tougher R&B than most would initially assume considering his cheesy leopard-print messiah phase. His cover of the Motown classic \"Standin’ In the Shadows of Love\" seems almost out of place but fits seamlessly amongst the late-‘70s debauchery that suggests plenty of illicit powder and mirrors being employed while the dance floor was warming up. \"The Best Days of My Life\" is a gentle, acoustic ballad that’s been sadly overlooked. Admittedly, there are few transcendent moments here, but it’s an accurate snapshot of the way ‘60s rockers were assimilating to the new world and technologies of the impending ‘80s.",

            "biography": "Roderick David \"Rod\" Stewart, CBE (born 10 January 1945) is a British rock singer-songwriter. Born and raised in London, he is of English and Scottish ancestry. Stewart is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold over 100 million records worldwide.\nHe has had six consecutive number one albums in the UK, and his tally of 62 UK hit singles includes 31 that reached the top 10, six of which gained the number one position. He has had 16 top ten singles in the US, with four reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2007, he received a CBE at Buckingham Palace for services to music.\nWith his distinctive raspy singing voice, Stewart came to prominence in the late 1960s and early 1970s with The Jeff Beck Group and then with Faces, though his music career had begun in 1962 when he took up busking with a harmonica. In October 1963 he joined the Dimensions as a harmonica player and part-time vocalist, then in 1964 he joined Long John Baldry and the All Stars. Later, in August 1964, he also signed a solo contract, releasing his first solo single, \"Good Morning Little Schoolgirl\", in October of the same year. He maintained a solo career alongside a group career, releasing his debut solo album An Old Raincoat Won't Ever Let You Down (US: The Rod Stewart Album), in 1969. His early albums were a fusion of rock, folk music, soul music and R&B. His aggressive blues work with The Jeff Beck Group and the Faces influenced heavy metal genres. From the late 1970s through the 1990s, Stewart's music often took on a new wave or soft rock/middle-of-the-road quality, and in the early 2000s he released a series of successful albums interpreting the Great American Songbook.\nIn 2008, Billboard magazine ranked him the 17th most successful artist on the \"Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists\". A Grammy and Brit Award recipient, he was voted at No. 33 in Q Magazine's list of the top 100 Greatest Singers of all time, and No. 59 on Rolling Stone 100 Greatest Singers of all time. As a solo artist, Stewart was inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006 and was inducted a second time into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012, as a member of the Faces."

It took the album's namesake eight years to achieve its commercial breakthrough, but once Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham signed on, there was no stopping the Mac. All the elements fell into place on this album: Buckingham's fluent guitar touch meshed with Mick Fleetwood and John McVie's rock-solid rhythmic base, with Christine McVie providing flowing keyboard lines and the entire group achieving a luminous vocal blend. Nicks' spellbinding \"\"Rhiannon\"\" and bittersweet \"\"Landslide\"\" launched her into the stratosphere of rock stardom. Christine McVie's sensuous \"\"Warm Waves\"\" and \"\"Say You Love Me\"\" were equally enticing. Buckingham's tunes — particularly the bluegrass-tinged \"\"Monday Morning\"\" — added yet another distinctive color. Fleetwood Mac has a vitality and magic that's undimmed by time.\"",

The band have sold more than 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. In 1998, selected members of Fleetwood Mac were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music.\nThe two most successful periods for the band were during the late 1960s British blues boom, when they were led by guitarist Peter Green and achieved a UK number one with \"Albatross\"; and from 1975 to 1987, as a more pop-oriented act, featuring Christine McVie, Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. Fleetwood Mac's second album after the incorporation of Buckingham and Nicks, 1977's Rumours, produced four U.S. Top 10 singles (including Nicks' song \"Dreams\"), and remained at No.1 on the American albums chart for 31 weeks, as well as reaching the top spot in various countries around the world. To date the album has sold over 40 million copies worldwide, making it the sixth-highest-selling album of all time.\nThe band achieved more modest success between 1971 and 1974, when the line-up included Bob Welch, during the 1990s in between the departure and return of Nicks and Buckingham, and during the 2000s between the departure and return of Christine McVie.\nDue to numerous lineup changes, the only original member present in the band is drummer Mick Fleetwood. Although band founder Green named the group by combining the surnames of two of his former bandmates (Fleetwood and McVie) from John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, bassist John McVie played neither on their first single nor at their first concerts, as he initially decided to stay with Mayall. Keyboardist Christine McVie, who joined the band in 1970 while married to John McVie, has appeared on every album except the debut album, either as a member or as a session musician. She left the band in 1998 but returned in 2014."

He is known for his neotraditionalist country style, cowboy look, and being one of the first and main country artists to bring country music back to its roots and away from the pop country era in the 1980s.\nStrait's success began when his first single \"Unwound\" was a hit in 1981. During the 1980s, seven of his albums reached number one on the country charts. In the 2000s, Strait was named Artist of the Decade by the Academy of Country Music, was elected into the Country Music Hall of Fame, and won his first Grammy award for the album Troubadour. Strait was named CMA Entertainer of the Year in 1989, 1990 and 2013, and ACM Entertainer of the Year in 1990 and 2014. He has been nominated for more CMA and ACM awards and has more wins in both categories than any other artist. In 2009, he broke Conway Twitty's previous record for the most number-one hits on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart when his 44 number one singles surpassed Twitty's 40. Counting all music charts, Strait has amassed a total of 60 number-one hits, breaking a record also previously set by Twitty, and giving him more number one songs than any other artist in any genre of music.\nStrait has sold more than 100 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling artists of all time. His certifications from the RIAA include 13 multi-platinum, 33 platinum, and 38 gold albums. His best-selling album is Pure Country (1992), which sold 6 million (6\u00d7 platinum). His highest certified album is Strait Out of the Box (1995), which sold 2 million copies (8\u00d7 Platinum due to being a box set with four CDs). According to the RIAA, Strait is the 12th best-selling album recording artist in the United States overall."

If everything had gone right, Black & Blue would have ruled the charts for about two years, but about a year after its release, the group and their label unleashed The Hits: Chapter One, a sure sign not only that Black & Blue didn't perform to expectations, but they were worried about the shifting tastes of their audience. Instead of reviving interest in the group, the collection instead felt like it was closing the door on their period of dominance (and it initially sold that way, too, barely making a dent on the charts). Even if it is a bit of an inadvertent last will and testament, it's a hell of a summation of the group's glory days, offering definitive proof that the group wasn't just the best of their breed (boy bands, that is; thrushes like Britney, Christina, Mandy, and Jessica are not taken into account here), but that their best moments transcend their era — and there's really no other way to describe such lovely pop tunes as \"I Want It That Way,\" \"As Long As You Love Me,\" and \"Quit Playing Games (With My Heart),\" three songs that would have sounded perfect in any era (and their vocals would have worked in any era, too). Those are just the ballads — the dance-pop numbers may be more tied to their era, but \"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" and \"Larger Than Life\" are infectious pop nonetheless. If the rest of the singles that fill out this 13-track collection aren't quite as good as those five songs (although \"Show Me the Meaning of Being Lonely\" is), they nevertheless are well-crafted, and those aforementioned singles are among the best mainstream pop of its time — which is not only reason enough for this collection to exist, it's reason enough for pop lovers of any age or generation to have this as part of their library.

The group then released two albums as a quartet: Unbreakable (2007) and This Is Us (2009).\nIn 2012, the group announced that Richardson had rejoined them permanently. In the following year they celebrated their 20th anniversary and released their first independent album, In a World Like This (2013). The group also released their first documentary movie, titled Backstreet Boys: Show 'Em What You're Made Of in January 2015.\nThe Backstreet Boys have sold over 130 million records worldwide, making them the best-selling boy band in history, and one of the world's best-selling music artists. They are the first group since Sade to have their first nine albums reach the top 10 on the Billboard 200, and the only boy band to do so. They also received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on April 22, 2013."

The classic lineup as signed to Geffen Records in 1986 consisted of vocalist Axl Rose, lead guitarist Slash, rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin, bassist Duff McKagan, and drummer Steven Adler. Today, Axl Rose is the only remaining original member, in a lineup that comprises Use Your Illusion\u2013era keyboardist Dizzy Reed, lead guitarists DJ Ashba and Ron \"Bumblefoot\" Thal, rhythm guitarist Richard Fortus, bassist Tommy Stinson, drummer Frank Ferrer, and keyboardist Chris Pitman. The band has released six studio albums to date, accumulating sales of more than 100 million records worldwide, including shipments of 45 million in the United States, making them one of the world's best-selling bands of all time.\nA year after its release, Guns N' Roses' debut album Appetite for Destruction (1987) reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200, on the strength of the hit \"Sweet Child o' Mine\", their only single to reach No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. The album has sold in excess of 28 million copies worldwide, including 18 million units sold in the United States, making it the best-selling debut album of all time in the U.S. The success of their debut was followed by the eight-song album G N' R Lies (1988) which reached No. 2 on the Billboard 200. The twin albums Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II (1991) debuted at No. 2 and No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and have sold a combined 35 million copies worldwide, including 14 million units sold in the United States alone. The cover album \"The Spaghetti Incident?\" (1993) was the band's last studio album to feature Slash and McKagan. After more than a decade of work and many lineup changes, Guns N' Roses released the long-awaited album Chinese Democracy (2008) which, at an estimated $14 million in production costs, made it the most expensive album to ever be produced in music history. It debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 but undersold industry expectations, despite mostly positive critical reception.\nGuns N' Roses have been credited with reviving the mainstream popularity of rock music, at a time when popular music was dominated by dance music and pop metal. Their late 1980s and early 1990s years have been described as the period in which they brought forth a \"hedonistic rebelliousness\" reminiscent of the early Rolling Stones, a reputation that had earned them the nickname \"The Most Dangerous Band in the World\". The band's classic lineup, along with later members Reed and drummer Matt Sorum, were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012, their first year of eligibility."

Both songs reached number-one on the Billboard Tropical Songs chart while \"Coraz\u00f3n Sin Cara\" reached number-one on the US Hot Latin Songs chart. The album itself reached number-one on the US Billboard Latin Albums and Tropical Albums charts. He also received three awards at the Billboard Latin Music Awards in 2011, which included Tropical Album of the Year for Prince Royce. Prince Royce was listed as one of the 50 Most Beautiful on the magazine People en Espa\u00f1ol in 2011. On April 10, 2012, Royce released his second studio album, Phase II. In November 2012, Royce released a compilation album entitled \"#1's\", a collection of his hits thus far."

With John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr, he gained worldwide fame as the bassist of British rock band the Beatles, one of the most popular and influential groups in the history of pop music; his songwriting partnership with Lennon is one of the most celebrated of the 20th century. After the band's break-up, he pursued a solo career and formed Wings with his first wife, Linda, and Denny Laine.\nMcCartney has been recognised as one of the most successful composers and performers of all time, with 60 gold discs and sales of over 100 million albums and 100 million singles of his work with the Beatles and as a solo artist. More than 2,200 artists have covered his Beatles song \"Yesterday\", more than any other copyrighted song in history. Wings' 1977 release \"Mull of Kintyre\" is one of the all-time best-selling singles in the UK. A two-time inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (as a member of The Beatles in 1988, and as a solo artist in 1999), and a 21-time Grammy Award winner (having won both individually and with the Beatles), McCartney has written, or co-written 32 songs that have reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, and as of 2014 he has sold more than 15.5 million RIAA-certified units in the United States. McCartney, Lennon, Harrison and Starr received MBEs in 1965, and in 1997, McCartney was knighted for his services to music.\nMcCartney has released an extensive catalogue of songs as a solo artist and has composed classical and electronic music. He has taken part in projects to promote international charities related to such subjects as animal rights, seal hunting, land mines, vegetarianism, poverty, and music education. He has married three times and is the father of five children."

            "biography": "Janet Damita Jo Jackson (born May 16, 1966) is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. Known for a series of sonically innovative, socially conscious and sexually provocative records, as well as elaborate stage shows, television and film roles, she has been a prominent figure in popular culture for over 25 years. The youngest child of the Jackson family, she began her career with the variety television series The Jacksons in 1976 and went on to appear in other television shows throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, including Good Times and Fame.\nAfter signing a recording contract with A&M Records in 1982, she became a pop icon following the release of her third studio album Control (1986). Her collaborations with record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis incorporated elements of rhythm and blues, funk, disco, rap, and industrial beats, which led to crossover success in popular music. In addition to receiving recognition for the innovation in her records, choreography, music videos, and prominence on radio airplay and MTV, she was acknowledged as a role model for her socially conscious lyrics.\nIn 1991, she signed the first of two record-breaking, multi-million dollar contracts with Virgin Records, establishing her as one of the highest paid artists in the industry. Her debut album under the label, Janet (1993), saw her develop a public image as a sex symbol as she began to explore sexuality in her work. That same year, she appeared in her first starring film role in Poetic Justice; since then she has continued to act in feature films. By the end of the 1990s, she was named the second most successful recording artist of the decade. The release of her seventh studio album All for You (2001) coincided with a celebration of her impact on popular music as the inaugural MTV Icon. After parting ways with Virgin she released her tenth studio album Discipline (2008), her first and only album with Island Records. In 2015, she partnered with BMG Rights Management to launch her own record label, Rhythm Nation Records.\nHaving sold over 160 million records, she is ranked as one of the best-selling artists in the history of contemporary music. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) lists her as the eleventh best-selling female artist in the United States, with 26 million certified albums. She has amassed an extensive catalog of hits, with singles such as \"Nasty\", \"Rhythm Nation\", \"If\", \"That's the Way Love Goes\", \"Together Again\" and \"All for You\" among her most distinguished on records chart. She holds the record for the most consecutive top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 by a female artist with 18. In 2008, Billboard magazine released its list of the Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists, placing her at number seven, while in 2010, ranking her fifth among the \"Top 50 R&B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years\". One of the world's most awarded artists, her longevity, records and achievements reflect her influence in shaping and redefining the scope of popular music. She has been cited as an inspiration among numerous performers."

This 1975 effort seems to be willing to explore sad emotions — with the more blithe songs appearing almost as an afterthought — which is actually a nice fit for Karen Carpenter's pitch-perfect and sorrowful voice, and emphasizes the duo's subtext. The beautifully arranged \"Aurora\" sets the album's ambience. \"Eventide,\" a continuation of the melody and theme, shows up later in the album. The covers, \"Desperado\" and \"Please Mr. Postman,\" have the duo adding nothing new to the tracks. A more convincing take on the standard \"I Can Dream, Can't I?\" was co-arranged and orchestrated by the legendary Billy May. The track has Carpenter's empathy and tone ringing clear. Another cover, \"Solitaire\" written by Neil Sedaka and Phil Cody, is melodramatic but a great match for Carpenter's voice. The originals, including \"(I'm Caught Between) Goodbye and I Love You,\" are competent but not magical. Although some might be put off by the sorrow-or-bust ethos of this, Horizon gains its strength from strong production values and, of course, Karen Carpenter's singular gifts as an interpreter. ",

They were ended in 1983 by Karen's death from heart failure brought on by complications of anorexia. Extensive news coverage surrounding the circumstances of her death increased public awareness of eating disorders.\nThe duo's brand of melodic pop produced a record-breaking run of hit recordings on the American Top 40 and Adult Contemporary charts, and they became leading sellers in the soft rock, easy listening and adult contemporary genres. Carpenters had three No. 1 singles and five No. 2 singles on the Billboard Hot 100 and fifteen No. 1 hits on the Adult Contemporary chart. In addition, they had twelve top 10 singles. To date, Carpenters' album and single sales total more than 100 million units."

Highway 61 is electric in every sense of the word, a nervy jangle that spins furiously about the twin axes of a full-fledged rock studio band (anchored by Al Kooper and Michael Bloomfield) and a taunting, spectral Dylan who shed the last vestiges of his folkie past to become one of the 60's most elusive icons. Powered by the reptilian licks of Bloomfield, the title track, \"From a Buick 6\" and \"Tombstone Blues\" have more to do with garage-savvy American proto-punk than Help! or Rubber Soul, the Beatles' releases that frame the 61 era. There may be nods to the blues (\"It Takes a Lot to Laugh..\") and his recent folk past (\"Desolation Row\"), but the intoxicating language Dylan serves up throughout transcend anything as mundane as mere genre. Poetically opaque, brilliantly snotty, and sometimes damn near inscrutable, it remains as consistently riveting as the day it was released.",

Nevertheless, early songs such as \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\" became anthems for the American civil rights and anti-war movements. Leaving his initial base in the American folk music revival, Dylan's six-minute single \"Like a Rolling Stone\" altered the range of popular music in 1965. His mid-1960s recordings, backed by rock musicians, reached the top end of the United States music charts while also attracting denunciation and criticism from others in the folk movement.\nDylan's lyrics have incorporated various political, social, philosophical, and literary influences. They defied existing pop music conventions and appealed to the burgeoning counterculture. Initially inspired by the performances of Little Richard, and the songwriting of Woody Guthrie, Robert Johnson and Hank Williams, Dylan has amplified and personalized musical genres. His recording career, spanning 50 years, has explored the traditions in American song\u2014from folk, blues, and country to gospel, rock and roll, and rockabilly to English, Scottish, and Irish folk music, embracing even jazz and the Great American Songbook. Dylan performs with guitar, keyboards, and harmonica. Backed by a changing line-up of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the Never Ending Tour. His accomplishments as a recording artist and performer have been central to his career, but his greatest contribution is considered his songwriting.\nSince 1994, Dylan has published six books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries. As a musician, Dylan has sold more than 100 million records, making him one of the best-selling artists of all time; he has received numerous awards including Grammy, Golden Globe, and Academy Award; he has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Minnesota Music Hall of Fame, Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, and Songwriters Hall of Fame. The Pulitzer Prize jury in 2008 awarded him a special citation for \"his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power.\" In May 2012, Dylan received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Barack Obama."

            "biography": "Def Leppard are an English rock band formed in 1977 in Sheffield as part of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal movement. Since 1992, the band has consisted of Rick Savage (bass, backing vocals), Joe Elliott (lead vocals), Rick Allen (drums, backing vocals), Phil Collen (guitar, backing vocals), and Vivian Campbell (guitar, backing vocals). This is the band's longest-standing line-up.\nThe band's strongest commercial success came between the early 1980s and the early 1990s. Their 1981 album High 'n' Dry was produced by Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, who helped them begin to define their style, and the album's stand out track \"Bringin' On the Heartbreak\" became one of the first rock videos played on MTV in 1982. The band's next studio album Pyromania in January 1983, with \"Photograph\" as the lead single, turned Def Leppard into a household name. In the U.S, Pyromania was certified Diamond (10\u00d7 Platinum). In 2003, the album ranked number 384 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\nDef Leppard's fourth album Hysteria, released in August 1987, topped the U.S. and UK album charts. As of 2009, it has reached beyond the success of Pyromania, having been certified 12\u00d7 Platinum for sales of over 12 million in the U.S. and has gone on to sell over 20 million copies worldwide. The album spawned seven singles, including the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number one \"Love Bites\", alongside \"Pour Some Sugar on Me\", \"Hysteria\", \"Armageddon It\", \"Animal\", \"Rocket\", and \"Women\".\nTheir next studio album Adrenalize (the first following the death of guitarist Steve Clark) reached number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 and UK Album Chart in 1992, and contained several hits including, \"Let's Get Rocked\" and \"Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad\". Their 1993 album Retro Active contained the acoustic hit song \"Two Steps Behind\", while their greatest hits album Vault released in 1995 featured the new track \"When Love & Hate Collide\".\nAs one of the world's best-selling music artists, Def Leppard have sold more than 100 million records worldwide, and have two albums with RIAA Diamond certification, Pyromania and Hysteria. They are one of only five rock bands with two original studio albums selling over 10 million copies in the U.S. The band were ranked No. 31 in VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\" and ranked No. 70 in \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\"."

Although primarily remembered as a country music icon, his genre-spanning songs and sound embraced rock and roll, rockabilly, blues, folk, and gospel. This crossover appeal won Cash the rare honor of multiple inductions in the Country Music, Rock and Roll and Gospel Music Halls of Fame.\nCash was known for his deep bass-baritone voice, the distinctive sound of his Tennessee Three backing band, a rebelliousness coupled with an increasingly somber and humble demeanor, free prison concerts, and a trademark look, which earned him the nickname \"The Man in Black\". He traditionally began his concerts with the simple \"Hello, I'm Johnny Cash\", followed by his signature \"Folsom Prison Blues\".\nMuch of Cash's music echoed themes of sorrow, moral tribulation and redemption, especially in the later stages of his career. His best-known songs included \"I Walk the Line\", \"Folsom Prison Blues\", \"Ring of Fire\", \"Get Rhythm\" and \"Man in Black\". He also recorded humorous numbers like \"One Piece at a Time\" and \"A Boy Named Sue\"; a duet with his future wife, June Carter, called \"Jackson\" (followed by many further duets after their marriage); and railroad songs including \"Hey, Porter\" and \"Rock Island Line\". During the last stage of his career, Cash covered songs by several late 20th-century rock artists, most notably \"Hurt\" by Nine Inch Nails."

They then received a Best New Artist nomination at the 2008 Grammy Awards. Their 2009 follow-up, Brand New Eyes, is the band's second-highest charting album to date, landing at number two on the Billboard 200 with 175,000 first week sales.

            "biography": "Evanescence is an American rock band founded in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1995 by singer/pianist Amy Lee and guitarist Ben Moody. After recording independent albums, the band released their first full-length album, Fallen, on Wind-up Records in 2003. Fallen sold more than 17 million copies worldwide and helped the band win two Grammy Awards and seven nominations, as well as scoring No. 6 in CBS's \"Top Bestselling Albums of the Last 10 Years\" (2008). A year later, Evanescence released their first live album, Anywhere but Home, which sold more than one million copies worldwide. In 2006, the band released their second studio album, The Open Door, which sold more than five million copies.\nThe line-up of the group has changed several times: David Hodges leaving in 2002, co-founder Moody left in 2003 (mid-tour), bassist Will Boyd in 2006, followed by guitarist John LeCompt and drummer Rocky Gray in 2007. The last two changes led to a hiatus, with temporary band members contributing to tour performances. Billboard ranked Evanescence No. 71 on the Best Artists of the Decade chart.\nAnnounced in June 2009, the newest line-up of the band eventually returned with Evanescence, their self-titled third studio album, released on October 11, 2011. It debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart with 127,000 copies in sales. The album also debuted at No. 1 on four other different Billboard charts; the Rock Albums, Digital Albums, Alternative Albums, and the Hard Rock Albums charts. The band spent 2012 on tour in promotion of their new album with other bands including The Pretty Reckless and Fair to Midland."

            "biography": "Florence and the Machine (styled as Florence + the Machine) are an English indie rock band that formed in London in 2007, consisting of lead singer Florence Welch, Isabella Summers, and a collaboration of other artists. The band's music received praise across the media, especially from the BBC, which played a large part in their rise to prominence by promoting Florence and the Machine as part of BBC Introducing. The band's music is renowned for its dramatic and eccentric production and also Welch's vocal performances.\nThe band's debut studio album, Lungs, was released on 6 July 2009, and held the number-two position for its first five weeks on the UK Albums Chart. On 17 January 2010, the album reached the top position, after being on the chart for twenty-eight consecutive weeks. As of October 2010, the album had been in the top forty in the United Kingdom for sixty-five consecutive weeks, making it one of the best-selling albums of 2009 and 2010. The group's second studio album, Ceremonials, released in October 2011, entered the charts at number one in the UK and number six in the US. The band's third album, How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful was released on 2 June 2015 and, after selling over 137,000 copies, debuted at number 1 on the US Billboard 200, their first to do so. It also topped the charts in seven other countries, including the UK. Also in 2015, the band was one of the headlining acts at Glastonbury Festival, with their set receiving widespread critical acclaim.\nFlorence and the Machine's sound has been described as a combination of various genres, including rock and soul. Lungs won the MasterCard British Album award at the 2010 BRIT Awards. At the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards, Florence and the Machine were nominated for Best New Artist. Additionally, the band performed at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards and the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize Concert."

Twain has sold over 85 million records, making her one of the world's best-selling artists of all time. She is also the best selling female artist in the history of country music, which garnered her honorific titles including the \"Queen of Country Pop\".\nTwain's second studio album, 1995's The Woman in Me, brought her widespread fame. It sold 20 million copies worldwide, spawning hits such as \"Any Man Of Mine\" and earning her a Grammy Award. Twain's third album, Come On Over, became the best-selling studio album of all time by a female act in any genre and the best-selling country album of all time, selling around 40 million copies worldwide. Come On Over produced several singles, including \"You're Still the One\", \"From This Moment On\" and \"Man! I Feel Like a Woman!\", and earned Twain four Grammy Awards. Her fourth and latest studio album, Up!, was released in 2002 and, like her previous two albums, was also certified Diamond in the U.S., spawning hits like \"I'm Gonna Getcha Good!\" and \"Forever and for Always\".\nTwain has received five Grammy Awards, 27 BMI Songwriter awards, stars on Canada's Walk of Fame and the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and an induction into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame. She is the only female artist in history to have three consecutive albums certified Diamond by the RIAA. Altogether, Twain is ranked as the 10th best-selling artist of the Nielsen SoundScan era.\nIn 2004, Twain retired from performing and retreated to her home in Switzerland. In her 2011 autobiography, she cited a weakening singing voice as the reason for not performing publicly. When both her singing and speaking were affected, Twain consulted the Vanderbilt Dayani Center in Nashville. Specialists discovered lesions on her vocal cords and diagnosed her with dysphonia, all treatable with careful rehabilitation. In 2012, Twain returned to the concert stage in her critically acclaimed show Still the One, exclusively at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace."

Nirvana went through a succession of drummers, the longest-lasting being Dave Grohl, who joined the band in 1990. Despite releasing only three full-length studio albums in their seven-year career, Nirvana has come to be regarded as one of the most influential and important rock bands of the modern era. n the late 1980s Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle grunge scene, releasing its first album Bleach for the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989. The band eventually came to develop a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. After signing to major label DGC Records, Nirvana found unexpected success with Smells Like Teen Spirit, the first single from the band's second album Nevermind (1991). Nirvana's sudden success widely popularized alternative rock as a whole, and the band's frontman Cobain found himself referred to in the media as the spokesman of a generation, with Nirvana being considered the flagship band of Generation X.[1] In response, Nirvana's third studio album, In Utero (1993), featured an abrasive, less-mainstream sound and challenged the group's audience. The album did not match the sales figures of Nevermind but was still a commercial success and critically acclaimed."

            "biography": "The Spice Girls were an English pop girl group formed in 1994. The group consisted of Melanie Brown (\"Scary Spice\"), Melanie Chisholm (\"Sporty Spice\"), Emma Bunton (\"Baby Spice\"), Geri Halliwell (\"Ginger Spice\"), and Victoria Beckham, n\u00e9e Adams (\"Posh Spice\"). They were signed to Virgin Records and released their debut single \"Wannabe\" in 1996, which hit number one in 37 countries and established them as a global phenomenon. Their debut album Spice sold more than 30 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling album by a female group in history. Their follow up album Spiceworld sold over 20 million copies worldwide. The Spice Girls have sold over 85 million records worldwide, making them the best-selling female group of all time, one of the best-selling pop groups of all time, and the biggest British pop phenomenon since Beatlemania.\nMeasures of their success include international record sales, a 2007\u20132008 reunion tour, merchandising, record-breaking achievements, iconic symbolism such as Halliwell's Union Jack dress representing \"girl power\", and a film, Spice World. The group became one of the most successful marketing engines ever, earning up to $75 million per year, with their global grosses estimated at $500\u2013800 million between 1996 and 1998. Under the guidance of their mentor and manager Simon Fuller, the Spice Girls embraced merchandising and became a regular feature of the British and global press. In 1996, Top of the Pops magazine gave each member of the group aliases, which were adopted by the group and media. According to Rolling Stone journalist and biographer David Sinclair, \"Scary, Baby, Ginger, Posh and Sporty were the most widely recognised group of individuals since John, Paul, George, and Ringo\". With the \"girl power\" phenomenon, the Spice Girls were popular cultural icons of the 1990s. They are cited as part of the 'second wave' 1990s British Invasion of the US."

Formed in 1996, the band rose to international fame with their debut album Hybrid Theory, which was certified Diamond by the RIAA in 2005 and multi-platinum in several other countries. Their following studio album Meteora continued the band's success, topping the Billboard 200 album chart in 2003, and was followed by extensive touring and charity work around the world. In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth-greatest band of the music video era and the third-best of the new millennium. Billboard ranked Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade chart. In 2012, the band was voted as the greatest artist of the 2000s in a Bracket Madness poll on VH1. In 2014, the band was declared as the Biggest Rock Band in the World Right Now by Kerrang.\nHaving adapted nu metal and rap metal to a radio-friendly yet densely layered style in Hybrid Theory and Meteora, the band explored other genres in their next studio album, Minutes to Midnight (2007). The album topped the Billboard charts and had the third-best debut week of any album that year. The band continued to explore a wider variation of musical types in their fourth album, A Thousand Suns (2010), layering their music with more electronic sounds and beats. Their fifth album, Living Things (2012), combines musical elements from all of their previous records. Their sixth and most recent album, The Hunting Party (2014), returned to a heavier rock sound. The band has collaborated with several other artists, most notably with rapper Jay-Z in their mashup EP Collision Course, and many others on the remix albums Reanimation and Recharged. Linkin Park has sold over 68 million albums worldwide and has won two Grammy Awards."

The ska vocalist group Wailers, which 8 years later should be a band, were formed when self-taught musician Hubert Winston McIntosh (Peter Tosh) met the singers Neville Livingston (Bunny Wailer), and Robert Nesta Marley (Bob Marley) in 1963. By late 1963 singers Junior Braithwaite, Beverley Kelso, and Cherry Smith had joined the Wailers, who was comped by music studio bands. In early 70s Bob and Bunny had learned to play some instruments and brothers Carlton Barrett and Aston \"Family Man\" Barrett on drums and bass had joined the reggae band. After Bunny Wailer and Peter Tosh left the band in 1974, Bob Marley began touring with new band members. His new backing band included Barrett brothers, Junior Marvin and Al Anderson on lead guitar, Tyrone Downie and Earl \"Wya\" Lindo on keyboards, and Alvin \"Seeco\" Patterson on percussion. The \"I Threes\", consisting of Judy Mowatt, Marcia Griffiths, and Marley's wife, Rita, provided backing vocals."

King's career began in the 1960s when she, along with her then husband Gerry Goffin, wrote more than two dozen chart hits for numerous artists, many of which have become standards. She has continued writing for other artists since then. King's success as a performer in her own right did not come until the 1970s, when she sang her own songs, accompanying herself on the piano, in a series of albums and concerts. After experiencing commercial disappointment with her debut album Writer, King scored her breakthrough with the album Tapestry, which topped the U.S. album chart for 15 weeks in 1971 and remained on the charts for more than six years.\nIn 2000, Joel Whitburn, a Billboard pop music researcher, named King the most successful female songwriter of 1955\u201399 because she wrote or co-wrote 118 pop hits on the Billboard Hot 100. She has written 61 hits on the UK charts. In 2005 music historian Stuart Devoy found her the most successful female songwriter on the UK singles charts 1952\u20132005.\nKing has made 25 solo albums, the most successful being Tapestry, which held the record for most weeks at No. 1 by a female artist for more than 20 years until broken by Whitney Houston (for the soundtrack album The Bodyguard). Her most recent non-compilation album was Live at the Troubadour in 2010, a collaboration with James Taylor that reached number 4 on the charts in its first week and has sold over 600,000 copies.\nShe has won four Grammy Awards and was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for her songwriting. She is the recipient of the 2013 Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song, the first woman to be so honored."

            "biography": "Simon & Garfunkel were an American folk rock duo consisting of singer-songwriter Paul Simon and singer Art Garfunkel. They were one of the most popular groups of the 1960s, and were viewed as counterculture icons of the decade's social revolution, alongside artists such as the Beatles and Bob Dylan. Their biggest hits\u2014including \"Mrs. Robinson\" (1968), \"The Sound of Silence\" (original 1964 and a re-released overdub in 1965), \"Bridge over Troubled Water\" (1969) and \"The Boxer\" (1969)\u2014reached number one on several charts worldwide apart from \"The Sound of Silence\". Their often rocky relationship led to artistic disagreements, which resulted in their breakup in 1970. Their final studio record, Bridge over Troubled Water, was their most successful, becoming one of the world's best-selling albums. Since their split in 1970 they have reunited several times, most famously in 1981 when they had \"The Concert in Central Park\", which attracted more than 500,000 people, the seventh-largest concert attendance in history.\nThe duo met as children in Queens, New York in 1953, where they learned to harmonize together and began writing original material. By 1957, under the name Tom & Jerry, the teenagers had their first minor success with \"Hey Schoolgirl\", a song imitating their idols the Everly Brothers. Afterwards, the duo went their separate ways, with Simon making unsuccessful solo records. In 1963, aware of a growing public interest in folk music, they regrouped and were signed to Columbia Records as Simon & Garfunkel. Their d\u00e9but, Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M., sold poorly, and they once again disbanded; Simon returned to a solo career, this time in England. A remix of their song \"The Sound of Silence\" gained airplay on U.S. radio in 1965, reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Simon & Garfunkel reunited, releasing their second studio album Sounds of Silence and touring colleges nationwide. On their third release, Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme (1966), the duo assumed more creative control. Their music was featured in the 1967 film The Graduate, propelling the duo to further exposure. Bookends (1968), their next album, benefited from this promotion, and increased their profile. After their 1970 breakup they both continued recording, Simon releasing a number of highly acclaimed albums, including 1986's Graceland; Garfunkel also carried on acting, including the lead in Nicolas Roeg's 1980 film Bad Timing.\nSimon & Garfunkel are considered the most popular folk rock act from the 1960s, and one of the most popular artists from the decade in general. Their music made a deep impression on the baby boomer generation, and they are considered alongside artists such as Bob Dylan and the Beatles to be representative of the era's cultural movements. They have been given 10 Grammy Awards, were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990, and their Bridge Over Troubled Water album was nominated at the 1977 Brit Awards for Best International Album, and ranked at #51 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time."

They released four studio albums between 1992 and 2002, which sold over 30 million copies worldwide, making them the third-most successful band from Sweden of all time, after ABBA and Roxette.\nHappy Nation / The Sign is one of the best-selling debut albums of all time, and was certified nine times platinum in the United States. It was the first debut album to produce three number 1 singles on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 chart: \"All That She Wants\", \"The Sign\" and \"Don't Turn Around\".\nFollowing the formal departure of singer Linn in 2007, the band performed a series of concerts as a trio in Europe and Asia from 2007 through 2009. Jenny revealed in November 2009 that she would be taking indefinite leave from the band to focus on a solo career. In 2009, Jonas and Ulf recruited two new female vocalists, Clara Hagman and Julia Williamson, and released The Golden Ratio in September 2010."

            "biography": "The Who are an English rock band that formed in 1964. Their classic line-up consisted of lead singer Roger Daltrey, guitarist Pete Townshend, bassist John Entwistle, and drummer Keith Moon. They are considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century, selling over 100 million records worldwide and establishing their reputation equally on live shows and studio work.\nThe Who developed from an earlier group, the Detours, and established themselves as part of the pop art and mod movements, featuring auto-destructive art by destroying guitars and drums on stage. Their first single as the Who, \"I Can't Explain\", reached the UK top ten, followed by a string of singles including \"My Generation\", \"Substitute\" and \"Happy Jack\". In 1967, they performed at the Monterey Pop Festival and released the US top ten single \"I Can See for Miles\", while touring extensively. The group's fourth album, 1969's rock opera Tommy, included the single \"Pinball Wizard\" and was a critical and commercial success. Live appearances at Woodstock and the Isle of Wight Festival, along with the live album Live at Leeds, cemented their reputation as a respected rock act. With their success came increased pressure on lead songwriter and visionary Townshend, and the follow-up to Tommy, Lifehouse, was abandoned. Songs from the project made up 1971's Who's Next, which included the hit \"Won't Get Fooled Again\". The group released the album Quadrophenia in 1973 as a celebration of their mod roots, and oversaw the film adaptation of Tommy in 1975. They continued to tour to large audiences before semi-retiring from live performances at the end of 1976. The release of Who Are You in 1978 was overshadowed by the death of Moon shortly after.\nKenney Jones replaced Moon and the group resumed activity, releasing a film adaptation of Quadrophenia and the retrospective documentary The Kids Are Alright. After Townshend became weary of touring, the group split in 1982. The Who occasionally re-formed for live appearances such as Live Aid in 1985, a 25th anniversary tour in 1989 and a tour of Quadrophenia in 1996. They resumed regular touring in 1999, with drummer Zak Starkey. After Entwistle's death in 2002, plans for a new album were delayed. Townshend and Daltrey continued as the Who, releasing Endless Wire in 2006, and continued to play live regularly.\nThe Who's major contributions to rock music include the development of the Marshall stack, large PA systems, use of the synthesizer, Entwistle and Moon's lead playing styles, and the development of the rock opera. They are cited as an influence by several hard rock, punk rock and mod bands, and their songs still receive regular exposure."

            "biography": "Katheryn Elizabeth \"Katy\" Hudson (born October 25, 1984), better known by her stage name Katy Perry, is an American singer, songwriter and actress. After singing in church during her childhood, she pursued a career in gospel music as a teenager. Perry signed with Red Hill Records and released her debut studio album Katy Hudson in 2001, which was commercially unsuccessful. She moved to Los Angeles the following year to venture into secular music after Red Hill ceased operations. After being dropped by The Island Def Jam Music Group and Columbia Records, Perry signed a recording contract with Capitol Records in April 2007.\nPerry rose to fame in 2008 with the release of the singles \"I Kissed a Girl\" \u2013 which had attention-grabbing and somewhat controversial lyrics \u2013 and \"Hot n Cold\" from her second album, a pop rock record titled One of the Boys. Her third album, Teenage Dream (2010), ventured into disco, and contained the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart-topping singles \"California Gurls\", \"Teenage Dream\", \"Firework\", \"E.T.\", and \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\" as well as the number-three single \"The One That Got Away\". The album became the first by a female artist to produce five number-one Billboard Hot 100 songs, and the second overall after Michael Jackson's album Bad (1987). In March 2012, she reissued the album as Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection, which produced the chart-topping singles \"Part of Me\" and \"Wide Awake\".\nHer fourth album, Prism, was released in 2013, and is influenced by pop and dance. It has spawned the number-one singles \"Roar\" and \"Dark Horse\". Her songwriting is mostly done in collaboration with others, especially Dr. Luke and Max Martin, and in songs such as \"Firework\" and \"Roar\" she stresses themes of self-empowerment and self-esteem. Perry is known for an idiosyncratic and fun-based sense of personal fashion that incorporates bright colors and food-based themes. Her concert performances feature elaborate stagings and costumings.\nPerry has received many awards, including three Guinness World Records, and been included in the Forbes list of \"Top-Earning Women In Music\" (2011\u201314). Throughout her career, she has sold 11 million albums and 81 million singles worldwide. Perry has also made celebrity endorsements and released perfumes Purr, Meow!, and Killer Queen. In July 2012, she released an autobiographical documentary titled Katy Perry: Part of Me, which concentrated on her life as a touring artist and the dissolution of her brief marriage to English actor and comedian Russell Brand in the early 2010s."

She held minor roles in the television series Doc and the film Big Fish in her childhood. In 2006, Cyrus rose to prominence as a teen idol after being cast in the Disney Channel television series Hannah Montana, in which she portrayed the starring character Miley Stewart. After signing a recording contract with Hollywood Records in 2007, Cyrus released her debut studio album Meet Miley Cyrus. It was certified quadruple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for exceeding four million shipments, and produced the hit single \"See You Again\".\nIn 2008, Cyrus released her second album Breakout, which featured the successful track \"7 Things\", and launched her film career as the voice actress in the animated film Bolt. In 2009, Cyrus starred in the feature film Hannah Montana: The Movie; its soundtrack produced the hit single \"The Climb\". Cyrus developed a maturing image with the EP The Time of Our Lives (2009), which featured the successful track \"Party in the U.S.A.\". The transition continued with her third album Can't Be Tamed (2010); the title track would become another top ten for Cyrus, however, it made little commercial impact and became the lowest-selling record of her career. Later that year, Cyrus starred in the coming-of-age film The Last Song. During its production, she was involved in an on-again, off-again relationship with her co-star Liam Hemsworth; the couple ultimately separated after ending their year-long engagement in 2013.\nCyrus focused on her acting career with several television and film appearances throughout 2011 and 2012. Cyrus later signed a recording contract with RCA Records, and generated controversy by cultivating a sexually explicit public image while promoting her fourth studio album Bangerz (2013). Its singles \"We Can't Stop\" and \"Wrecking Ball\" were promoted with controversial music videos; the latter became her first number-one hit on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.\nCyrus has had five non-consecutive number-one albums on the U.S. Billboard 200, two of which are soundtracks credited to her titular character Hannah Montana, and has earned numerous awards and nominations. In 2010, Cyrus ranked number thirteen on Forbes\u200d\u200a'\u200b Celebrity 100, and was named the \"Most Charted Teenager\" in the 2011 Guinness World Records with twenty-nine Billboard Hot 100 entries as of November 2009. In 2013, she was declared \"Artist of the Year\" by MTV."

            "biography": "Green Day is an American punk rock band formed in 1986 by vocalist/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong and bassist Mike Dirnt. For much of their career, the band has been a trio with drummer Tr\u00e9 Cool, who replaced former drummer John Kiffmeyer in 1990 prior to the recording of the band's second studio album, Kerplunk (1992). In 2012, guitarist Jason White became a full-time member after having performed with the band as a session and touring member since 1999.\nGreen Day was originally part of the punk scene at the DIY 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, its major label debut Dookie (released through Reprise Records) became a breakout success and eventually sold over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day was widely credited, alongside fellow California punk bands Sublime, Bad Religion, The Offspring and Rancid, with popularising and reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States.\nGreen Day's three follow-up albums, Insomniac (1995), Nimrod (1997), and Warning (2000) did not achieve the massive success of Dookie, though they were still successful, with Insomniac and Nimrod reaching double platinum and Warning achieving gold status. The band's rock opera, American Idiot (2004), reignited the band's popularity with a younger generation, selling five million copies in the U.S. The band's eighth studio album, 21st Century Breakdown, was released in 2009 and achieved the band's best chart performance to date. 21st Century Breakdown was followed up by a trilogy of albums called \u00a1Uno!, \u00a1Dos!, and \u00a1Tr\u00e9!, which were released in September, November and December of 2012 respectively.\nThey are one of the world's best-selling bands of all time, having sold more than 75 million records worldwide. The group has won five Grammy Awards: Best Alternative Album for Dookie, Best Rock Album for American Idiot, Record of the Year for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\", Best Rock Album for the second time for 21st Century Breakdown and Best Musical Show Album for American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording. In 2010, a stage adaptation of American Idiot debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for three Tony Awards: Best Musical, Best Scenic Design and Best Lighting Design, losing only the first. Also in 2010, Green Day were ranked no. 91 in the VH1 list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". On April 18, 2015, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a part of the 2015 class, in their first year of eligibility."

The band is based in Toronto.\nAfter signing to Jive Records, Three Days Grace has released five studio albums, each at three-year intervals: Three Days Grace in 2003, One-X in 2006, Life Starts Now in 2009, Transit of Venus in 2012, and Human in 2015. The first three albums have been RIAA certified platinum, platinum, and gold, respectively, in the United States, whereas in Canada they have been certified by Music Canada as platinum, double platinum, and platinum, respectively. The band has a string of number one songs on the Billboard Alternative Songs and Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks charts.\nAt the start of 2013, Three Days Grace announced that lead singer Adam Gontier was resigning from the band because of a \"non-life-threatening\" health issue. Adam Gontier was replaced by My Darkest Days frontman Matt Walst, the brother of bassist Brad Walst, shortly thereafter. He was confirmed as an official member in 2014 and appeared on the band's 2015 album Human."

            "biography": "Black Sabbath are an English rock band, formed in Birmingham in 1968, by guitarist and main songwriter Tony Iommi, bassist and main lyricist Geezer Butler, singer Ozzy Osbourne, and drummer Bill Ward. The band have since experienced multiple line-up changes, with guitarist Iommi being the only constant presence in the band through the years. Originally formed in 1968 as a blues rock band, the group soon adopted the Black Sabbath moniker and began incorporating occult themes with horror-inspired lyrics and tuned-down guitars. Despite an association with these two themes, Black Sabbath also composed songs dealing with social instability, political corruption, the dangers of drug abuse and apocalyptic prophecies of the horrors of war.\nOsbourne's regular abuse of drugs and alcohol led to his dismissal from the band in 1979. He was replaced by former Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio. Following two albums with Dio, Black Sabbath endured countless personnel changes in the 1980s and 1990s that included vocalists Ian Gillan, Glenn Hughes, Ray Gillen and Tony Martin, as well as several drummers and bassists. In 1992, Iommi and Butler rejoined Dio and drummer Vinny Appice to record Dehumanizer. The original line-up reunited with Osbourne in 1997 and released a live album Reunion. Black Sabbath's 19th studio album, 13, which features all of the original members but Ward, was released in June 2013.\nBlack Sabbath are often cited as pioneers of heavy metal music. The band helped define the genre with releases such as Black Sabbath (1970), Paranoid (1970) and Master of Reality (1971). They were ranked by MTV as the \"Greatest Metal Band\" of all time, and placed second in VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\" list. Rolling Stone magazine ranked them number 85 in their \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". They have sold over 70 million records worldwide. Black Sabbath were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. They have also won two Grammy Awards for Best Metal Performance."

            "biography": "Alice in Chains is an American rock band formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1987 by guitarist and songwriter Jerry Cantrell and original lead vocalist Layne Staley. The initial lineup was rounded out by drummer Sean Kinney and bassist Mike Starr, who was replaced in 1993 by Mike Inez.\nAlthough widely associated with grunge music, the band's sound incorporates heavy metal elements. Since its formation, Alice in Chains has released five studio albums, three EPs, two live albums, four compilations, and two DVDs. The band is known for its distinctive vocal style, which often included the harmonized vocals of Staley and Cantrell.\nAlice in Chains rose to international fame as part of the grunge movement of the early 1990s, along with other Seattle bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. The band was one of the most successful music acts of the 1990s, selling over 20 million albums worldwide, and over 14 million in the US alone. In 1992 the band's second album, Dirt, was released to critical acclaim and was certified quadruple platinum. Their third album, Alice in Chains, was released in 1995 and has been certified double platinum. Both albums achieved No. 1 Billboard 200 releases. The band has had 14 top ten songs on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and nine Grammy Award nominations.\nAlthough never officially disbanding, Alice in Chains was plagued by extended inactivity from 1996 onwards due to Staley's substance abuse, which resulted in his death in 2002. The band reunited in 2005 for a live benefit show, performing with a number of guest vocalists. They toured in 2006, with William DuVall taking over as lead vocalist full-time. The new line-up released the band's fourth studio album, Black Gives Way to Blue, in 2009. The album received gold certification by the RIAA. In 2013, the band released The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here, its fifth studio album. The band has toured extensively and released several videos in support of these albums. Alice in Chains is currently working on their sixth studio album, which is slated to be released in late 2015."

Born in Tappahannock, Virginia, he taught himself to sing and dance at a young age and was involved in his church choir and several local talent shows. Having signed with Jive Records in 2004, Brown released his self-titled debut studio album the following year. It peaked at number two on the US Billboard 200 and was later certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). With his first single \"Run It!\" peaking atop the US Billboard Hot 100, Brown became the first male artist as a lead since Diddy in 1997 to have his debut single top the chart. His second album Exclusive (2007) spawned his second Hot 100 number one \"Kiss Kiss\", in addition to \"With You\" and \"Forever\". The album was also certified double platinum by the RIAA.\nIn 2009, Brown received much media attention after pleading guilty to felony assault of his then-girlfriend, singer Rihanna; he was sentenced to five years of probation and six months of community service. His third album Graffiti was released later that year, and included the top-twenty single \"I Can Transform Ya\". Brown's fourth album F.A.M.E. (2011) became his first to top the Billboard 200; it spawned hit singles \"Yeah 3x\", \"Look at Me Now\", and \"Beautiful People\". F.A.M.E. earned Brown his first Grammy Award for Best R&B Album at the 54th Grammy Awards. His fifth album Fortune was released in 2012. However, after the release of Exclusive, Brown's albums have not been well received by music critics, with the exception of X, which received a normalized rating of 63.\nApart from his work in the music industry, Brown has pursued an acting career. In 2007, he made his on-screen feature film debut in Stomp the Yard, and appeared as a guest on the television series The O.C. Other films Brown has appeared in, include This Christmas (2007), Takers (2010), Think Like a Man (2012), and Battle of the Year (2013). Throughout his career, Brown has won numerous awards, including two NAACP Image Awards, three American Music Awards and fourtheen BET Awards."

            "biography": "Maroon 5 is an American pop rock band that originated in Los Angeles, California. Before the group was formed the original four members of then 1994 band were known as Kara's Flowers while its members were still in high school and originally consisted of Adam Levine (lead vocals, guitar), Jesse Carmichael (guitar, backing vocals) Mickey Madden (bass guitar) and Ryan Dusick (drums). The band, which self-released an album called We Like Digging?, was named after a girl the group had a crush on. They signed to Reprise Records and released an album, The Fourth World, in 1997. After a tepid response to the album, the band parted ways with the record label and the members attended college.\nIn 2001, the band changed their image by adding guitarist James Valentine and pursuing a new direction under the name Maroon 5. At this point, Carmichael switched to playing keyboards, which has since become his main instrument in the band. After these changes, Maroon 5 signed with Octone Records and released their debut album, Songs About Jane, in June 2002. The album's lead single, \"Harder to Breathe\", received heavy airplay, which helped the album to debut at number six on the Billboard 200 chart. The band won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 2005. For the next few years, they toured extensively worldwide in support of Songs About Jane and produced two live recordings: 2004's 1.22.03.Acoustic and 2005's Live \u2013 Friday the 13th. In 2006, Dusick officially left Maroon 5 after suffering from serious wrist and shoulder injuries and was replaced by Matt Flynn. The band then recorded their second album, It Won't Be Soon Before Long and released it in May 2007. The album reached number one on the US Billboard 200 chart and the lead single, \"Makes Me Wonder\", became the band's first number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100.\nIn September 2010, Maroon 5 released their third studio album Hands All Over, which was re-released in 2011 to include the single \"Moves like Jagger\". While the original version of the album received mixed reviews, \"Moves like Jagger\" reached the number one position on the Billboard Hot 100. The band released their fourth album, Overexposed, on June 26, 2012. All four singles of the album were highly successful on the Billboard Hot 100, including second single \"One More Night\", which reached number one. In 2014, the band signed with Interscope Records and released their fifth studio album, V, with the very-first line-up of six official band members, as keyboardist and backing vocalist PJ Morton became an official member in 2012. The same year, a longtime friend of the band and bass player of Phantom Planet, Sam Farrar, became an official touring member, performing the keyboards with Carmichael and Morton. The album debuted atop the Billboard 200. Maroon 5 has sold more than 27 million albums and 48 million singles worldwide."

            "biography": "Dwayne Michael Carter, Jr. (born September 27, 1982), known by his stage name Lil Wayne, is an American rapper from New Orleans, Louisiana. In 1991, at the age of nine, Lil Wayne joined Cash Money Records as the youngest member of the label, and half of the duo The B.G.'z, alongside fellow New Orleans-based rapper Lil' Doogie. In 1996, Lil Wayne formed the southern hip hop group Hot Boys, with his Cash Money label-mates Juvenile, Young Turk and Lil' Doogie (who now goes by B.G.). Hot Boys debuted with Get It How U Live!, that same year. Most of the group's success came with their platinum-selling album Guerrilla Warfare (1999) and the 1999 single \"Bling Bling\". Along with being the flagship artist of Cash Money Records, Lil Wayne is also the chief executive officer (CEO) of his own label imprint, Young Money Entertainment, which he founded in 2005.\nLil Wayne's solo debut album Tha Block Is Hot (1999), was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). His subsequent albums, Lights Out (2000) and 500 Degreez (2002), went on to be certified gold. Wayne reached higher popularity with his fourth album Tha Carter (2004), which was led by the single \"Go D.J.\" and his appearance on Destiny's Child's Top 10 single \"Soldier\", that same year. The album was followed by Tha Carter II (2005), as well as several mixtapes and collaborations throughout 2006 and 2007. Wayne gained more prominence with his sixth album Tha Carter III (2008), which became his most successful album to date, with first-week sales of over one million copies in the United States. The album won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album and includes the hit singles \"Lollipop\", \"A Milli\" and \"Got Money\".\nFollowing the success of Tha Carter III, Wayne decided to record a rock-esque album titled Rebirth. The album, released in 2010, was certified gold by the RIAA, despite a generally negative critical response. In March 2010, Lil Wayne began serving an 8-month jail sentence in New York after being convicted of criminal possession of a weapon stemming from an incident in July 2007. Wayne's eighth album I Am Not a Human Being (2010), was released during his incarceration. His 2011 album and first following his release, Tha Carter IV, sold 964,000 copies in its first week of availability in the United States. It includes the singles \"6 Foot 7 Foot\", \"How to Love\" and \"She Will\". On September 27, 2012, Lil Wayne passed Elvis Presley as the male with the most entries on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, with 109 songs. Lil Wayne's eleventh studio album, Tha Carter V has been delayed multiple times and has no scheduled release date."

Musically and artistically precocious, Sia became interested in performing in the style of musicians including Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder and Sting. In the mid-1990s, Sia started a career as a singer in the local Adelaide acid jazz band Crisp. By 1997, when Crisp disbanded, Sia released her debut studio album titled OnlySee on Flavoured Records in Australia. Following the event, Sia moved to London, England and provided lead vocals for British duo Zero 7. In 2000, Sia signed to Sony Music's sub-label Dance Pool and released her second studio album, Healing Is Difficult, the following year. Displeased with the promotion of the record, Sia signed to Go! Beat and released her third studio album, Colour the Small One, in 2004. Dissatisfied with the project's struggling to connect with a mainstream audience, Sia relocated to New York City in 2005 and began touring across the United States. Sia released her fourth and fifth studio releases, Some People Have Real Problems and We Are Born, in 2008 and 2010, respectively. In 2014, Sia released her sixth studio album, 1000 Forms of Fear, which was preceded by the top-ten single Chandelier. She is currently working on her seventh studio album This Is Acting."

            "biography": "Kanye Omari West (/\u02c8k\u0251\u02d0nje\u026a/; born June 8, 1977) is an American rapper, songwriter, record producer and fashion designer. West first became known as a producer for Roc-A-Fella Records; he achieved recognition for his work on rapper Jay-Z's The Blueprint (2001), as well as hit singles for musical artists including Alicia Keys, Ludacris, and Janet Jackson. His style of production originally used high-pitched vocal samples from soul songs incorporated with his own drums and instruments. He later broadened his influences to include 1970s R&B, baroque pop, trip hop, arena rock, house, folk, alternative, electronica, synthpop, industrial, and classical music.\nWest was raised in a middle-class household in Chicago, Illinois, and began rapping in the third grade, becoming involved in the city's hip hop scene. West attended art school for one semester before dropping out to pursue music entirely in the late 1990s. Although his real desire was to become a rapper, record executives did not take West seriously, viewing him as a producer first and foremost. After being signed to Roc-A-Fella in 2002, West released his debut album The College Dropout in 2004 to commercial and critical acclaim. The baroque-inspired Late Registration followed in 2005, and Graduation in 2007. West switched rapping for singing on his emotive 2008 effort 808's & Heartbreak, and embraced maximalism on 2010's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. Following several collaborations, West released his abrasive sixth album, Yeezus, in 2013.\nWest is one of the best- selling artists of all time, having sold more than 21 million albums and 100 million digital downloads. He has won a total of 21 Grammy Awards, making him one of the most awarded artists of all- time and the most Grammy-awarded artist of his age. Time named West one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2005, 2011 and 2015. He has also been included in a number of Forbes annual lists. Three of his albums rank on Rolling Stone's 2012 \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" list; two of his albums feature at #8 and #1 in Pitchfork Media's The 100 Best Albums of 2010\u20132014.\nWest's background and style, from his debut album, deviated from the then-dominant \"gangsta\" persona in hip hop, and he would later alter the genre stylistically as rappers adopted his alternative aesthetic. An outspoken and controversial celebrity, West has often been a source of controversy due to his appearances at award shows and his various television and radio interviews. West has collaborated on multiple occasions with brands Nike, Louis Vuitton, Adidas and A.P.C.. West also runs his own record label GOOD Music and has directed several short films.",

            "biography": "An R&B vocalist affiliated with the outlandish hip-hop crew Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All, Frank Ocean (Christopher \"Lonny\" Breaux) was born and raised in New Orleans. The aspiring songwriter and singer had just moved into his dorm at the University of New Orleans when Hurricane Katrina hit. With his future under water, Ocean immediately left the academic life behind and moved to L.A. to give music a shot. He cut some demos at a friend's home studio, shopped them around town, and eventually landed a songwriting deal that would find him working for Justin Bieber, John Legend, and Brandy. Some of this work was alongside Christopher \"Tricky\" Stewart, a fellow songwriter and producer who would convince Ocean to sign a solo artist deal with Def Jam in late 2009. It was also around this time he met Odd Future and began writing music for the crew while making guest appearances on their mixtapes. In February 2011, as Odd Future were making waves, Ocean broke out on his own with the Nostalgia, Ultra mixtape, issued through his Tumblr blog. Later in the year, he appeared on Tyler, the Creator's Goblin (\"She,\" \"Window\"), Beyoncé's 4 (\"I Miss You\"), and Jay-Z and Kanye West's Watch the Throne (\"No Church in the Wild,\" \"Made in America\"). Def Jam's plan for the release of Nostalgia, Lite — an EP-length version of the mixtape — was scrapped, yet the songs \"Novacane\" (produced by Stewart) and \"Swim Good\" (MIDI Mafia) were released as singles with accompanying videos. The former reached number 17 on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart. The latter peaked at number 70. By the end of the year, several publications listed Nostalgia, Ultra as one of 2011's best releases. While his association with Def Jam had been strained, Ocean nonetheless proceeded with the making of his official debut album, working beside the likes of Malay, Om'Mas Keith, and Pharrell Williams as fellow producers. The album, Channel Orange, was previewed for journalists at a handful of listening events. Some writers alleged that certain lyrics on the album revealed Ocean's bisexuality. Ocean subsequently published a screen shot of a TextEdit file (entitled \"thank you's\") that included details of a romantic relationship — his first love — with a male. On July 10, six days after the post, Channel Orange was released by Def Jam as a download, while the CD version was issued the following week. Along with featured appearances from Earl Sweatshirt, John Mayer, and André 3000, the album involved material about unrequited love, as well as class and drug dependency — all delivered with Ocean's descriptive storytelling and understated yet expressive vocals. The album would go on to be an all-around success, receiving nearly universal critical acclaim, a spot on the Billboard 200, and a host of Grammy nominations.",

            "biography": "Platinum-selling, Grammy-nominated rapper Kendrick Lamar is one of the rare artists who has achieved critical and commercial success while earning the respect and support of those who inspired him. A native of Compton, California, Lamar originally rapped as K. Dot and released a series of mixtapes under that name. Youngest Head N***a in Charge (2003), issued when he was only 16 years old, caught the attention of Top Dawg Entertainment and led to a long-term association that helped raise the rapper's profile. Training Day (2005) and C4 (2009) also preceded his decision to go by his birth name. The latter was issued the same year he became part of Black Hippy — beside fellow Top Dawg artists Ab-Soul, Jay Rock, and ScHoolboy Q — a group whose members, for the most part, appeared on one another's mixtapes and albums. Overly Dedicated (2010) was the first Kendrick Lamar mixtape and fared well enough to enter Billboard's R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart that October. His first official album, Section.80 (2011), was released as a digital download the following year and entered the Billboard 200 at number 113. By that point in his career, Lamar's reputation had been strengthened through guest appearances on dozens of tracks, and he had the support of veteran West Coast stars as well. During a 2011 concert, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and Game dubbed him \"The New King of the West Coast,\" a notion Dre endorsed more significantly by signing Lamar to the Aftermath label. Lamar's Good Kid, M.A.A.D City was released in October 2012 and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200. Three of its singles — \"Swimming Pools (Drank),\" \"Poetic Justice,\" and \"Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe\" — reached the Top Ten of Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart, with each one enjoying lengthy stays on playlists of urban U.S. radio stations. More significantly, the album showcased Lamar as an exceptional storyteller capable of making compelling concept albums. When the nominees for the 56th Annual Grammy Awards were announced, Lamar was listed in seven categories, including Best New Artist and Album of the Year. He won none of the awards. Rather than rest, Lamar remained active during 2013-2014 with touring as well as appearances on tracks by the likes of Tame Impala, YG, and fellow Top Dawg affiliate SZA. Early in 2015, he announced his third album, To Pimp a Butterfly, was due in March with tracks featuring Snoop Dogg, Bilal, Thundercat, and George Clinton. A technical accident caused the digital album to be released eight days early, but it immediately earned rave reviews and sales of 325,000 copies within its first week of release.", "youtube_url_1": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z-48u_uWMHY",
